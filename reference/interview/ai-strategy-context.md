## Spencer's Pre-Interview AI Inquiry Strategy

### Email to Hiring Manager (Tom)
**Sent:** Before interview
**Purpose:** Proactive information gathering and strategic positioning

**Goals:**
1. **Understand LAM's AI environment** - Learn their tech stack and policies to speak intelligently about integration
2. **Pre-frame AI superpower** - Plant the seed that I bring AI expertise before interview
3. **Qualify the opportunity** - If they don't support AI usage, this may not be the right fit
4. **Gather context** - Tailor interview pitch based on their specific environment

---

## Spencer's AI Capabilities & Track Record

### Proven Results
- **RAG database of job experience** - Structured knowledge retrieval system
- **Custom resume/cover letter generation** - Tailored per job description
- **20% interview hit rate** - 2 interviews from only 10 applications
- **ATS filter navigation** - "Blow through ATS filters" with strategic keyword optimization
- **Previous experience at Thermo Fisher** - Made AI work despite "anemic tools"

### Technical Approach
- AI-assisted engineering workflow (not AI-autonomous)
- Critical engineering judgment maintained
- Adaptable to corporate policies and tool restrictions
- Focus on force multiplication, not replacement

## Interview Pitch Strategy

### 1. AI as Force Multiplier for EE Work

**Talking Points:**
- **Design iteration acceleration** - Rapid prototyping of circuit concepts, parametric sweeps
- **Simulation efficiency** - AI-assisted SPICE model generation, failure mode analysis
- **Documentation quality** - Auto-generate technical specifications from design constraints
- **Standards research** - Quickly parse regulatory requirements (UL, CE, FCC, semiconductor-specific)

**LAM-Specific Example:**
> "For semiconductor equipment, AI can accelerate the translation of process requirements (etch uniformity, chamber temp stability) into electrical specifications (heater control bandwidth, sensor resolution). Instead of spending 2 days researching specs, I can focus 2 hours on critical design decisions."

---

### 2. Team/Company Benefits (Not Just Personal Productivity)

**Talking Points:**
- **Knowledge capture** - Convert tribal knowledge into searchable, reusable format
- **Onboarding acceleration** - New engineers get context faster (schematics, design rationale, vendor history)
- **Design review efficiency** - AI pre-screens for common issues (power budget violations, thermal concerns)
- **Cross-functional communication** - Translate EE constraints into mechanical/software language

**LAM-Specific Example:**
> "In semiconductor equipment, there's huge interdependency between electrical, mechanical, and process engineering. AI can help me quickly generate 'why this matters' documentation - like explaining why a power supply ripple spec impacts plasma stability. This reduces back-and-forth and speeds up cross-team alignment."

---

### 3. Semiconductor-Specific AI Applications

**Talking Points:**
- **Test data analysis** - Pattern recognition in chamber qualification data, sensor drift detection
- **Yield optimization** - Correlate electrical parameters (RF power, gas flow control) with process outcomes
- **Failure analysis** - Rapid root cause investigation by searching historical failure modes
- **Supplier qualification** - Fast comparison of component datasheets against LAM requirements

**LAM-Specific Example:**
> "For a braille display actuator, AI helped me research 4 actuator technologies (piezo, solenoid, SMA, micro-motor) in hours instead of days. For LAM equipment, this same approach applies to motor controllers, RF generators, or vacuum feedthroughs - quickly narrow down vendors and technologies that meet your unique constraints."

### 4. Addressing Anticipated Concerns

#### **Concern: Data Security & IP Protection**
**Response:**
- "I'm adaptable to company policies - if LAM has air-gapped tools, I work within that. If cloud AI is allowed with data sanitization, I leverage that."
- "Critical IP stays internal - I never upload proprietary schematics or customer data. AI is for general research, standards parsing, and documentation templates."
- "At Thermo Fisher, I navigated restrictive IT policies by focusing on publicly available data (datasheets, standards, published research)."

#### **Concern: Accuracy & Verification**
**Response:**
- "AI-assisted is not AI-autonomous. Every circuit I design, I verify with hand calculations, SPICE, and peer review."
- "AI accelerates the 'first 80%' - it helps me generate options faster. The final 20% (critical analysis, safety margins, failure modes) is 100% human engineering judgment."
- "Example: AI suggests a voltage regulator IC. I still verify load transient response, thermal dissipation, and worst-case input voltage."

#### **Concern: Tool Governance / Company Policies**
**Response:**
- "I asked about LAM's AI stack upfront because I want to work *within* your policies, not around them."
- "If LAM has approved tools (e.g., Microsoft Copilot, internal ChatGPT), I use those. If not, I adapt."
- "My goal is to bring AI *value* to LAM, not create IT headaches. I'm happy to collaborate with IT/legal to define safe usage boundaries."

## Concrete Examples to Reference

### Example 1: Job Search RAG Database
- **Challenge:** Apply to jobs efficiently without copy-paste resume spam
- **AI Solution:** Built RAG database of past projects, skills, and results
- **Outcome:** Generated custom resumes/cover letters in 15 minutes instead of 2 hours
- **Engineering Parallel:** Same approach for design history files - "find all past projects with RS-485 communication and thermal chambers"

### Example 2: ATS Filter Navigation
- **Challenge:** Get past automated applicant tracking systems
- **AI Solution:** Analyze job description, extract keywords, optimize resume structure
- **Outcome:** 20% interview rate (industry average ~2-5%)
- **Engineering Parallel:** Automated compliance checking - "does this BOM meet RoHS and REACH requirements?"

### Example 3: Thermo Fisher Experience
- **Challenge:** Company had restrictive IT policies, limited AI tools
- **AI Solution:** Used publicly available tools (ChatGPT free tier, Claude) for non-proprietary research
- **Outcome:** Still accelerated literature review, standards research, supplier comparisons
- **Engineering Parallel:** Even with restrictions, AI adds value for non-sensitive tasks

## LAM-Specific Value Proposition

### Equipment Design Documentation Efficiency
- **Pain Point:** Semiconductor equipment has complex documentation requirements (design specs, test protocols, service manuals)
- **AI Solution:** Auto-generate first drafts from engineering notes, maintain consistency across documents
- **Value:** Faster time-to-market, fewer documentation errors

### Cross-Functional Communication (EE ↔ SW ↔ Mechanical)
- **Pain Point:** Electrical constraints (EMI, grounding, power sequencing) often misunderstood by other disciplines
- **AI Solution:** Generate "translation documents" - explain EE requirements in mechanical/software context
- **Value:** Reduce integration issues, fewer design respins

### Regulatory/Standards Compliance Acceleration
- **Pain Point:** Semiconductor equipment must meet safety (UL, CE), EMC (FCC, CISPR), and industry standards (SEMI S2, S8)
- **AI Solution:** AI parses standards documents, flags relevant clauses, suggests design approaches
- **Value:** Reduce compliance risk, faster certification

## Questions to Ask Interviewers

1. **"What's LAM's current stance on AI tools for engineering? Are there approved platforms, or is it case-by-case?"**
   - *Goal: Understand governance model, show I respect policies*

2. **"How does LAM handle knowledge capture when senior engineers retire or move teams?"**
   - *Goal: Position AI as solution to institutional knowledge loss*

3. **"What's the biggest bottleneck in your current electrical design process - is it component selection, simulation time, documentation, or something else?"**
   - *Goal: Identify where AI could add immediate value*

4. **"How much cross-functional collaboration happens between EE, SW, and mechanical? What tools do you use to stay aligned?"**
   - *Goal: Highlight AI's role in communication/translation*

## Email Thread with Mike (Context)

**Spencer → Mike (Sep 30):**
> "Not sure if you have had time to address this but any feedback on the proposal? Any adjustments needed?"

**Mike → Spencer (Oct 1):**
> "Sorry, I don't mean to ghost you. I don't have any feedback yet, but this is high on my list."

**Status:** Awaiting Mike's feedback on proposal (unclear what proposal - possibly related to AI strategy or interview prep materials)
