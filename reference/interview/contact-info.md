Hi Spencer

I am a recruiter here at Lam Research and we have an Electrical Engineering role open that I was told the team would like to interview you for. I just sent you another email to a link if you can apply to the role, it would be great. As part of the interviews there will be a presentation portion. I have attached a guide to help you with that.

One of my scheduling team will reach out to you once you have applied to the position and we can get you set up to come onsite to meet with the team.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Nathan,

Thank you for following up and for sending the presentation guide - I appreciate that.

I enjoyed meeting with the hiring manager and his director about this opportunity, and I'm definitely interested in moving forward. I'll submit my application through the portal today so we can get the interview process scheduled.

Looking forward to meeting with the team onsite and learning more about the role.

Thanks again,
Spencer
