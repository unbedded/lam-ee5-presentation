## üé§ Delivery Best Practices

### Energy & Pacing
- **Start strong:** First 2 minutes set the tone - confident, clear
- **Vary pace:** Slow down for critical points (braille constraint, decision tree)
- **Pause for impact:** After takeaway slides, let it sink in (2-3 sec)
- **Don't rush:** If you hit 30 min, that's fine - better than racing through

### Transitions to Practice
1. **Section 1 ‚Üí Section 2:** "Now that you know my approach, let's dive into requirements - the foundation of everything."
2. **Section 2 ‚Üí Section 3:** "With 17 requirements defined, I explored 3 alternative architectures."
3. **Section 3 ‚Üí Section 4:** "Three viable options - how do we choose? Trade-off analysis."
4. **Section 4 ‚Üí Section 5:** "Recommendation: SOL_ECO for pilot. Here's the execution plan."
5. **Section 5 ‚Üí Section 6:** "That's the path to pilot in 8 weeks. Questions?"

### Body Language (In-Person)
- Stand, don't sit (if possible)
- Face the panel, not the screen
- Use hand gestures for emphasis (spider chart, decision tree)
- Make eye contact with all interviewers

### Voice
- Project clearly (they need to hear you)
- Vary tone to avoid monotone
- Emphasize key numbers: "$506", "2.3mm", "8 weeks"
- Pause before/after TAKEAWAY slides

---

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Getting stuck on one slide:** If you blank, read the TAKEAWAY and move on
2. **Going too deep on backup slides:** Resist urge to explain everything - save for Q&A
3. **Apologizing:** Don't say "this slide is busy" or "sorry for the detail" - own it
4. **Rushing the requirements:** This is where you prove rigor - don't skip
5. **Missing time checkpoints:** Glance at timer at each checkpoint - adjust pace

---

## üìä Self-Assessment Rubric

After each practice run, rate yourself 1-10:

| Criteria | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Target |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Timing (27-30 min) | | | | 9+ |
| Confidence (no stumbling) | | | | 8+ |
| Energy (not monotone) | | | | 8+ |
| Transitions (smooth) | | | | 7+ |
| Key points hit | | | | 9+ |
| Stayed on slide (no wandering) | | | | 8+ |

**Goal:** All 8+ by final practice run

---

## üéØ Priority Practice Areas

Based on complexity and rubric weight:

### HIGH PRIORITY (Practice 3+ times)
1. **Slide 8-9:** Requirements ground truth + derived (establishes credibility)
2. **Slide 19:** Decision tree explanation (critical to trade-off story)
3. **Slide 22-24:** Cost/timeline/risk (30% of rubric - must be crisp)
4. **Slide 34:** Summary + Q&A transition (last impression)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Practice 2 times)
1. **Slide 13-18:** Architecture subsystems (technical depth)
2. **Slide 28-33:** Pilot execution (20% of rubric)

### LOW PRIORITY (Practice 1 time)
1. **Slide 1-5:** Intro (straightforward)
2. **Slide 6-7:** Requirements overview (setup, not critical)
3. **Slide 20, 27:** Takeaways (just read them)

## ‚ùì Anticipated Q&A Topics

Have 30-second answers ready:

### Technical Deep-Dives
- **"Why did you choose SOL_ECO over PIEZO_ECO?"**
  - "Cost-constrained pilot, excellent manufacturability, acceptable robustness. PIEZO is plan B if vibration becomes issue."

- **"What's your biggest technical risk?"**
  - "Actuator sourcing - 3-4 week lead time. Mitigation: order immediately upon approval, have backup supplier."

- **"How did you validate the 2.3mm size constraint?"**
  - "Derived from Braille Authority standards: 2.5mm pitch - 1.5mm dot diameter. Cited in requirements.yaml."

### Process Questions
- **"How would you handle requirement changes mid-pilot?"**
  - "Requirements.yaml is SSOT - change there, regenerate docs, assess impact on timeline/cost."

- **"What if user testing fails?"**
  - "Success criteria defined (30N force, 1Hz refresh). If fail, debug root cause - likely actuator performance or control timing."

### Scope Questions
- **"Why only 6 pilot units?"**
  - "Minimum for validation: 2 for durability testing, 2 for user testing, 2 for backup. Scales to 100+ in production phase."

- **"What about wireless charging?"**
  - "Out of scope for 8-week pilot. PIEZO_DLX architecture includes BLE for future wireless features."

### Meta Questions
- **"What would you do differently?"**
  - "More supplier outreach earlier - actuator sourcing is critical path. Also, earlier stakeholder review of assumptions."

- **"How does this compare to your past projects?"**
  - "Similar to [medical device project] - constrained timeline, regulatory considerations, user-centered validation."
