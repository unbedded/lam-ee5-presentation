# EE Concept Evaluation - Problem Statement

## Overview
This document captures the complete problem statement for the Lam Research Electrical Engineering Concept Evaluation interview challenge.

---

## Design Context

**Role:** Electrical Engineer at Company Z
**Timeline:** 2 months to production release
**Objective:** Lead critical electrical engineering project to meet customer deadline

---

## Product Vision

### Objective
Develop a **portable, low-cost, high-volume companion device** to a cell phone that enables sight-impaired individuals to read text from their mobile device.

### Function
- Display a single line of braille text (32 characters)
- Update the line of braille to read the next line of text after current line is read
- Interface with cell phone to receive text information

---

## Technical Specifications

### System Requirements
- **Input:** Text information from cell phone
- **Output:** Control signals to 32 braille characters
- **Character Definition:** Each character has 6 dots (raised or lowered based on control signals)
- **Total Control Signals:** 192 individual control points (32 characters × 6 dots)

### Design Constraints
- **Portability:** Must be portable companion device
- **Cost:** Low-cost design for high-volume manufacturing
- **Manufacturing:** High-volume production capability
- **Timeline:** Production-ready within 2 months
- **Interface:** Compatible with cell phone connectivity

---

## Scope of Work

As the lead electrical engineer, you are responsible for designing the electronics system with the following deliverables:

### 1. Requirements Identification
Identify key technical requirements, including:
- System-level specifications
- Electrical specifications
- Other relevant design requirements

### 2. Solution Development
Develop and describe **multiple alternative solutions** for the electronics design.

### 3. Trade-off Analysis
Evaluate proposed solutions by discussing:
- Advantages of each approach
- Disadvantages and limitations
- Other considerations influencing final selection
- Justification for recommended solution

### 4. Path to Production
Outline the process for transitioning the concept from initial design to volume production, addressing the 2-month timeline constraint.

## Interview Deliverables

### Presentation Requirements
- **Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Format:** Any presentation format that best supports your solution
- **Delivery:** Digital content must be emailed to recruiter 24 hours prior (USB drives not supported)
- **Equipment:** HDMI projection available in interview room

### Interview Evaluation Criteria
Lam Research seeks to understand:
1. How you develop engineering concepts
2. How you make engineering decisions
3. Your ability to communicate technical solutions
4. Your approach to production-ready design

### Interview Structure (90 minutes total)
- Introductions: 15 minutes
- Background Discussion: 5 minutes
- **Concept Evaluation Presentation: 30 minutes**
- **Q&A on Evaluation: 15 minutes**
- Candidate Questions and Wrap-up: 15 minutes

## Reference Information

### Braille Alphabet
Each braille character consists of a 2×3 grid of dots:
- 6 dots total per character
- Each dot can be raised (1) or lowered (0)
- Different combinations represent different letters/characters

### Design Challenge Summary
**From:** Text on cell phone screen
**To:** 192 control signals (32 characters × 6 dots each)
**Through:** Electronics system you design
**Within:** Constraints of portability, low cost, high volume, 2-month timeline
