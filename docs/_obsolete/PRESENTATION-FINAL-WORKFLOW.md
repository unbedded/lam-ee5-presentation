  border-bottom: 3px solid #3498db;  /* Blue */
}
table thead th {
  background-color: #2980b9 !important;  /* Blue */
}

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Title takes too much space
**Fix:** Reduce `h1` font-size (line 11):
```css
h1 {
  font-size: 36px;  /* Was 40px */
}
```

### Issue: Table too wide
**Fix:** Reduce columns or make font smaller:
```css
table {
  font-size: 18px;  /* Was 20px */
}
```

### Issue: Image doesn't show
**Fix:** Ensure image is in `source/` directory:
```bash
cp path/to/image.svg source/
```

Then use in Markdown:
```markdown
![Description](image.svg)
```

### Issue: Slide has too much content
**Fix:** Split into 2 slides:
```markdown
---

# Original Title (Part 1)

First half of content...

---

# Original Title (Part 2)

Second half of content...

---
```
