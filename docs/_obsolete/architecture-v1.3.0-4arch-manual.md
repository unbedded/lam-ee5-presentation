## Executive Summary

This document presents **4 distinct solution architectures** for the 32-character refreshable braille display, each optimizing different trade-off priorities:

| Architecture | Nickname | BOM Cost | Market Position | Key Differentiator |
|--------------|----------|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **ARCH-B** | Value Desk | $420 | Entry-level/Education | Simplest, fastest to pilot (USB-C wired) |
| **ARCH-C** | Mainstream Mobile | $436 | Mid-range/Consumer | Best flexibility (BLE+USB dual, AA battery) |
| **ARCH-D** | Budget Mobile | $224 | Budget/NGO | Lowest cost (solenoid+latch, 48% savings) |
| **ARCH-A** | Premium Pro | $449 | Premium/Professional | Sleekest UX (BLE wireless, integrated Li-ion) |

**Recommendation for 2-month pilot:** Start with **ARCH-B** (wired, fastest to pilot), validate with **ARCH-D** latch prototype (if latch works → 48% cost savings), scale with **ARCH-C** (best mainstream UX).

## Requirements Traceability

All architectures satisfy the 9 ground truth requirements from the PDF (PRD-FUNC-001 through PRD-VOL-001). Architecture selection is driven by **assumption scenarios** in `source/requirements.yaml`:

- **PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP:** Defines 3 interface scenarios (BLE-only, USB-only, Hybrid)
- **PRD-COST-001-ASMP:** Defines 3 BOM ranges ($100-150, $200-250, $250-300)
- **PRD-SCHED-002-ASMP:** COTS mandate (≤4 week lead time) → Drives ARCH-D solenoid choice
- **PRD-POWER-003/004/005-ASMP:** USB/AA/Li-ion power budgets → Drives actuator selection

**See:** `artifacts/rubric-reports/req-traceability-report.md` for complete mapping.

### ARCH-D: Hybrid (Solenoid+Latch)

**Nickname:** "Budget Mobile"
**Market Position:** Budget-Conscious / Long Battery Life / Acceptable UX Trade-off
**Strategy:** Radical cost reduction via COTS solenoids + mechanical latch. Accept slower refresh + larger size for 48% BOM savings.

#### Requirements Driven By

- **PRD-SCHED-002-ASMP:** COTS mandate (≤4 week lead) → Use COTS solenoid (Takaha BS-0420N-01, 2-week lead)
- **PRD-POWER-004-ASMP:** AA battery life (8 hours) → Solenoid+latch = 1.53W (marginal fit vs piezo 2.16W)
- **PRD-FUNC-003-ARCH-C-EXCEPT:** Allow 4mm actuator (relaxed from 2.3mm), 3.5mm cell pitch, 280mm device
- **PRD-COST-001-ASMP:** Low BOM target ($150-180) via actuator cost savings

#### Subsystems

**Core (modified for solenoid):**
- SS-ACTUATOR-SOLENOID: $96.00 (192× @ $0.50 ea, vs piezo $288 = **$192 savings**)
- SS-ACTUATOR-LATCH: $13.00 (global latch plate + latch solenoid)
- SS-CONTROL: $8.00 (STM32G474 MCU)
- SS-IO-EXPAND: $4.80 (2× MCP23017 I2C expanders)
- SS-ACTUATOR-DRIVER-2CH: $4.80 (2 channels vs 8 = **$14.40 savings**)
- SS-USER-IO: $0.50
- SS-PCB: $18.00 (4-layer, larger for 280mm device)
- SS-ENCLOSURE: $30.00 (larger for 280mm length)

**Unique to ARCH-D:**

- SS-POWER-AA-HOLDER: $2.00
- SS-POWER-AA-BOOST-3V3: $2.25
- SS-POWER-AA-BOOST-12V: $2.25 (12V for solenoid overdrive, not 30V)

**BOM Total:** $224 (**48% lower than ARCH-C**, within $150-180 target range!)

#### Specifications

| Category | Qualitative | Quantitative |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Size** | VERY LARGE | 280mm × 105mm × 25mm, 1.28 lbs (**40% longer**) |
| **Power** | AA battery (6V, 2500mAh) | 1.53W consumption, **8 hours runtime** (longest) |
| **Performance** | **SLOW refresh** | **5.2 sec** full update (vs 1.5 sec piezo, **3.5× slower**) |
| **Timeline** | MODERATE | 8.5 weeks total (3 design + 3 proto + 2.5 pilot) |
| **Complexity** | VERY COMPLEX mechanical | 280 components, 25 min assembly time |
| **Certification** | MODERATE (FCC 15C radio) | $26.5K cert cost, 6 weeks |
| **Manufacturing** | FAIR DFM (latch risk) | **90% yield** (latch alignment issues) |

#### Mechanical Latch Concept

**See:** `docs/actuator-mechanical-latch-concept.md` for complete analysis.

**Executive Summary:**
- **NOT using custom solenoid** → Uses COTS 4mm solenoid (Takaha BS-0420N-01, Digikey stock)
- **Size exception required** → Standard braille: 2.3mm actuator max, COTS solenoid: 4mm min
- **Resolution:** Relax to 3.5mm cell pitch → Device grows 200mm → 280mm (40% longer)

**Latch Mechanism:**
1. **Overdrive mode (10ms pulse):** 2.4× voltage (28.8V) → 5.76× force → Actuators fire
2. **Latch engages:** Global plate captures all 192 dot positions via detents/friction
3. **Solenoids OFF:** Zero hold power (vs 9.6-19.2W continuous for solenoid without latch)
4. **Duty cycle:** 6.8% @ 5-sec refresh (340ms active / 5s period)

**RISK:** Latch mechanism unproven. Requires prototype validation in Week 3-4.

#### Advantages

- **Lowest BOM cost** → $224 vs $435 ARCH-C (**48% savings**, fits $150-180 target!)
- **COTS compliant** → 2-week solenoid lead time (meets PRD-SCHED-002-ASMP)
- **Longest battery life** → 8 hours (vs 4 hours ARCH-C piezo, 18 hours ARCH-C due to lower power)
- **AA globally available** → No charger needed
- **Actuator cost savings** → $96 solenoid vs $288 piezo (**$192 savings**)

#### Disadvantages

- **Slow refresh** → 5.2 sec vs 1.5 sec piezo (**3.5× slower**, may frustrate fast readers)
- **Very large device** → 280mm vs 200mm (**40% longer**, less portable)
- **Heavy** → 1.28 lbs vs 1.21 lbs ARCH-C
- **Latch mechanism unproven** → HIGH technical risk (requires prototyping)
- **Complex mechanical assembly** → Latch alignment critical, lower yield (90% vs 95-98%)
- **Low DFM** → Detent tolerances, friction issues, precision alignment required

#### When ARCH-D Wins

- **Cost is CRITICAL** → Budget-constrained buyers (NGOs, developing markets)
- **Battery life matters** → Users need 8+ hours runtime without charging
- **Slow refresh acceptable** → Beginners, educational use (not professional speed readers)
- **COTS mandate enforced** → 2-month timeline requires ≤4 week lead time parts

#### When ARCH-D Fails

- **Latch prototype fails** → If Week 3-4 validation shows friction/binding issues → Fallback to ARCH-C with 6× AA (10.5Wh → 2.1W budget → piezo fits)
- **Fast readers** → Professional users need <2 sec refresh (5.2 sec unacceptable)
- **Portability priority** → 280mm device too large for mobile use

- **Highest certification cost** → $35K (FCC 15C + UL 2054 battery safety)
- **Longest certification time** → 8 weeks (vs 4-6 weeks others)
- **Battery anxiety** → User forgot to charge? (vs instant AA swap ARCH-C/D)
- **No wired fallback** → BLE drops = device unusable (vs USB fallback ARCH-C/D)
- **Li-ion safety risk** → Thermal runaway, shipping restrictions (vs AA exempt)
- **Global charger complexity** → 110V/220V adapter variations

#### When ARCH-A Wins

- **Premium market** → Professional users willing to pay for best wireless UX
- **Sleek design priority** → Mobile professionals, business travelers
- **Single-interface simplicity** → BLE-only firmware (no dual-stack complexity)

#### When ARCH-A Fails

- **Cost matters** → 2× over budget ($449 vs $200-250 target)

## Recommendations

### For 2-Month Pilot Production

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6): Validate with ARCH-B**
- **Why:** Fastest to pilot (6 weeks), lowest risk, proven technology
- **Goal:** Validate actuator technology, firmware, user feedback
- **Deliverable:** 100 units for beta testing

**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-5): Prototype ARCH-D latch**
- **Why:** IF latch works → 48% BOM savings ($224 vs $436)
- **Goal:** Validate mechanical latch concept (critical risk)
- **Decision gate:** Week 5 — Latch works? Proceed to ARCH-D. Latch fails? Fallback to ARCH-C.

**Phase 3 (Weeks 6-8): Scale with ARCH-C or ARCH-D**
- **If latch succeeds:** Scale ARCH-D (lowest cost $224)
- **If latch fails:** Scale ARCH-C (best mainstream UX, dual interface)

### For Long-Term Product Strategy

**Product Portfolio Approach:**
1. **ARCH-B** → Entry-level/Education market ($100-150 target, needs cost reduction)
2. **ARCH-D** → Budget/NGO market ($150-180 target, IF latch validated)
3. **ARCH-C** → Mainstream consumer market ($210-230 target)
4. **ARCH-A** → Premium professional market ($200-250 target)

**Cost Reduction Roadmap (v1.4.0):**

- Enclosure: 3D print → injection mold ($25 → $5 per unit @ 10K volume)
- PCB: 4-layer → 2-layer ($15 → $8 per unit via smart routing)
