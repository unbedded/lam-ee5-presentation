# Night Work Summary - 2025-10-08

**While You Were Sleeping:** Automated transforms and derived documents

---

## What Was Completed (Autonomous Work)

### 1. ✅ Updated `/req-yaml-to-md` Slash Command

**File:** `.claude/commands/req-yaml-to-md.md`

**Changes:**
- Updated from old naming scheme (SYS-*, EE-*, MFG-*, etc.)
- Now supports hierarchical PRD naming:
  - PRD-SCHED-NNN, PRD-SIZE-NNN, PRD-IFACE-NNN, PRD-COST-NNN, PRD-VOL-NNN, PRD-USER-NNN, PRD-FUNC-NNN
  - PRD-XXXX-NNN-ASMP (assumptions)
- Extracts new fields: `pdf_verbatim`, `pdf_says`, `our_assumption`, `risk_level`, `customer_validation_needed`, `sensitivity_range`

### 2. ✅ Generated `artifacts/requirements.md`

**File:** `artifacts/requirements.md` (34KB, professional document)

**Contents:**
- **Executive Summary:**
  - 15 total requirements (9 ground truth + 6 assumptions)
  - 7 P0-Critical (47%), 8 P1-High (53%)
  - 3 CLEAR (33%), 6 VAGUE (67%)
  - 1 CRITICAL risk, 2 HIGH risks, 3 MEDIUM risks
- **Full Requirements Catalog:**
  - All 9 PRD-XXXX-NNN (ground truth from PDF)
  - All 6 PRD-XXXX-NNN-ASMP (assumptions with rationale)
  - Acceptance criteria, test plans, sensitivity ranges
- **Standards Compliance:**
  - US ADA Section 703.3 (braille dimensions)
  - FCC/CE/UL (awareness, not certification)
  - Battery safety (UL 2054 / IEC 62133)
- **Customer Validation Tracker:**
  - 6 assumptions flagged for stakeholder review
  - Risk levels, sensitivity ranges, test plans
- **Phase Gate Checklist:**
  - Next steps to freeze requirements before v1.3.0

---

## Document Lineage (Single Source of Truth)

```
source/requirements.yaml (SSOT)
    ↓ [transform: /req-yaml-to-md]
artifacts/requirements.md (human-readable report)
```

**Key Insight:** `requirements.yaml` is the ONLY source you edit. `requirements.md` is auto-generated (READ-ONLY).

## Key Statistics

### Requirements Breakdown

| Category | Ground Truth | Assumptions | Total |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Schedule (PRD-SCHED) | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Size (PRD-SIZE) | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Interface (PRD-IFACE) | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Cost (PRD-COST) | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Volume (PRD-VOL) | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| User (PRD-USER) | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Functional (PRD-FUNC) | 3 | 1 | 4 |
| **Total** | **9** | **6** | **15** |

### Risk Distribution (Assumptions)

| Risk Level | Count | Requirements |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | 1 | PRD-COST-001-ASMP ($200 ±$100 BOM) |
| 🔴 HIGH | 2 | PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP (BLE vs USB-C), PRD-VOL-001-ASMP (10k/month) |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | 3 | PRD-SCHED-001-ASMP (pilot vs mass), PRD-SIZE-001-ASMP (≤1.3 lbs), PRD-FUNC-002-ASMP (<2 sec refresh) |

### Customer Validation Needed

**ALL 6 assumptions require customer validation!**

Most critical:
1. **PRD-COST-001-ASMP:** $200 BOM ±$100 (CRITICAL risk)
2. **PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP:** BLE vs USB-C vs hybrid (HIGH risk)
3. **PRD-VOL-001-ASMP:** 10k units/month target (HIGH risk)

---

## What's Left To Do (When You Wake Up)

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Review `artifacts/requirements.md`**
   - Check for accuracy, completeness
   - Verify assumptions make sense
   - Confirm sensitivity ranges

2. **Run `/req-audit`** (pending slash command)
   - Validate requirements structure
   - Check for missing fields
   - Verify traceability

3. **Phase Gate v1.2.0 Completion:**
   - ✅ Ground truth requirements extracted (9)
   - ✅ Assumptions documented (6)
   - ✅ Single source of truth (requirements.yaml)
   - ⏳ Audit validation
   - ⏳ Customer review (if available)
   - ⏳ FREEZE requirements.yaml

4. **Proceed to v1.3.0: Architecture Design**
   - Design portfolio at different cost points:
     - Architecture A: BLE wireless ($200-250 BOM)
     - Architecture B: USB-C wired ($100-150 BOM) ← low-cost option!
     - Architecture C: Hybrid BLE+USB ($250-300 BOM)
   - Actuator technology selection
   - Microcontroller selection
   - Power/weight budgets

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `artifacts/requirements.md` (34KB) - Human-readable requirements report
- `artifacts/NIGHT-WORK-SUMMARY.md` (this file)
- `docs/_obsolete/assumptions-register.md.v1` (moved old file)

### Modified:
- `.claude/commands/req-yaml-to-md.md` - Updated for hierarchical PRD naming
- `TIME-LOG.md` - Added 2.5h refactor session
- `source/requirements.yaml` - Complete rewrite (v2.0.0)

### Obsoleted:
- `docs/assumptions-register.md` → `docs/_obsolete/assumptions-register.md.v1`

---

## Time Tracking Update

**Session:** 2.5 hours (refactor + transforms)
**Total logged:** 12.0 hours
**Remaining:** 72.0 hours
**Pace:** 6.0 hrs/day (exactly on target!)
**Projected completion:** 2025-10-20 (3 days before deadline)
**Status:** ✅ Ahead of schedule

---

## Makefile Integration (Future Work)

**Suggested Makefile targets:**

```makefile
# Requirements transforms
requirements-md: source/requirements.yaml
	/req-yaml-to-md

requirements-trace: source/requirements.yaml
	/req-trace

requirements-audit: source/requirements.yaml
	/req-audit

# All requirements artifacts
requirements-all: requirements-md requirements-trace requirements-audit

# Clean generated files
clean-requirements:
	rm -f artifacts/requirements.md
	rm -f artifacts/traceability-matrix.md
```

**Benefits:**
- One command regenerates all derived docs
- Ensure consistency (YAML → MD → Trace)
- Makefile enforces build order
- Clean target for fresh regeneration

## Key Design Insights from Tonight's Work

### 1. USB-C Wired is a Valid Low-Cost Option

**PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP explicitly calls this out:**
- Architecture B: USB-C wired, no battery, $100-150 BOM savings
- Tethered to phone = still portable, just less convenient
- Great option for cost-sensitive markets

### 2. Portfolio Approach for v1.3.0

Instead of picking ONE architecture, design multiple:
- Cost range: $100-$300 BOM
- Interface options: BLE, USB-C, hybrid
- Let v1.4.0 trade-off analysis rank them
- Present portfolio to customer (they pick)

### 3. Customer Validation is Critical

67% of requirements are VAGUE → need customer feedback:
- "Is $200 BOM reasonable, or $100? or $300?"
- "Is pilot (100-500 units) OK, or need mass production in 2 months?"
- "Is 10k/month 'high volume', or 100k/month?"

v1.4.0 sensitivity analysis tests all scenarios.

## Recommended Morning Workflow

1. **Coffee ☕**
2. **Read this summary**
3. **Review `artifacts/requirements.md`** (34KB, take your time)
4. **Check git status** (lots of changes to commit)
5. **Run `/req-audit`** (validate structure)
6. **Decide:** Ready for phase gate? Or more refinement?
7. **If ready:** Move to v1.3.0 (Architecture Design)

---

## Questions to Consider (When You Wake Up)

1. **Cost assumption:** Is $200 ±$100 BOM reasonable? Or should we target $150? $250?
2. **USB-C wired option:** Should we prioritize this as Architecture A (lowest cost)?
3. **Pilot production:** Is 100-500 units correct interpretation? Or did PDF mean mass production?
4. **Volume assumption:** Is 10k/month realistic? Or 1k/month? 100k/month?
5. **Customer validation:** Do you have a way to validate assumptions with LAM interviewers before interview?

## Git Commit Suggestion

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(v1.2.0): Refactor requirements with hierarchical PRD naming

- Extract 9 ground truth requirements from PDF (PRD-XXXX-NNN)
- Create 6 assumptions for vague requirements (PRD-XXXX-NNN-ASMP)
- Rewrite requirements.yaml as single source of truth (v2.0.0)
- Generate requirements.md with TOC, summaries, risk analysis
- Update /req-yaml-to-md slash command for PRD naming
- Move old assumptions-register.md to _obsolete
- Log 2.5h refactor session (12.0h total, on pace)

BREAKING CHANGE: Old naming scheme (SYS-*, EE-*, MFG-*) replaced with
hierarchical PRD naming (PRD-SCHED-001, PRD-COST-001-ASMP, etc.)

## Sleep Well! 🌙

Solid progress tonight. Requirements foundation is now rock-solid. Ready for v1.3.0 architecture design when you wake up.

**Next big milestone:** Design portfolio of 3-4 architectures at different cost points.
