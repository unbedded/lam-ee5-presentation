# Assumptions Register - Braille Display Device

**Project:** LAM Research EE Concept Evaluation
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Source:** `source/requirements.yaml` (metadata.assumptions)

---

## Purpose

This register documents all assumptions made due to incomplete/vague requirements in the PDF assignment. Each assumption has:
- **Unique ID** for traceability
- **Risk level** (impact if assumption is wrong)
- **Test plan** (where we validate or test sensitivity)

**Key Insight:** LAM intentionally left requirements vague to test engineering judgment. Documenting assumptions + testing them = professional approach.

## Critical Assumptions (Highest Impact)

### ASMP-COST-001: "Low-Cost" Interpretation
**What PDF Says:** "portable, low-cost, high-volume companion device"
**What We Assume:** <$50 BOM at 1000-unit volume
**Why:** Competitor braille displays retail $449-$1,795 (BrailleMe $515, Orbit Reader $449, APH Refreshabraille $1,795). Assuming 40% BOM ratio → ~$180-210 BOM. PDF says "low-cost" - interpreting as <$50 BOM to **undercut market by 70%+** and enable emerging market accessibility.
**Risk:** CRITICAL - Wrong assumption eliminates/enables entire architectures
**Test Plan:** Sensitivity analysis in v1.4.0
- If actual target is $30 → Eliminates most architectures
- If actual target is $50 → Baseline design (aggressive cost reduction)
- If actual target is $100 → Enables higher-reliability options
- If actual target is $150 → Premium architectures competitive with existing products

**Competitor Data (verified 2025-10-08):**
- BrailleMe: $515.50 retail (20-cell, 1.3 lbs, Perkins keyboard, BLE/USB/SD)
- Orbit Reader: $449 (20-cell refreshable display)
- APH Refreshabraille: $1,795 (18-cell display)
- OrCam MyEye: $150 (braille reader, not display - discontinued)

---

### ASMP-MKT-001: Market Assumption
**What PDF Says:** "low-cost, high-volume"
**What We Assume:** China/India emerging markets (price-sensitive)
**Why:** Language suggests cost-sensitive market, not premium US/EU
**Risk:** HIGH - Changes stakeholder priorities significantly
**Test Plan:** Sensitivity analysis in v1.4.0
- If US/EU market → Unit cost tolerance +$30-50, UX/reliability weights increase
- If China/India → Cost is king, time-to-market critical

---

### ASMP-VOL-001: Volume Interpretation
**What PDF Says:** "high-volume manufacturing"
**What We Assume:** >10,000 units/year production capability
**Why:** Global market ~285M visually impaired, 0.01% penetration = 28K/year potential
**Risk:** HIGH - Affects DFM requirements, tooling decisions, component selection
**Test Plan:** Sensitivity analysis in v1.4.0
- If 1K/year → Hand assembly acceptable, lower NRE
- If 100K/year → Full automation required, higher NRE

---

### ASMP-COMP-001: COTS Components
**What PDF Says:** (implicit in 2-month timeline)
**What We Assume:** Must use off-the-shelf actuators, no custom fabrication
**Why:** 2-month timeline prohibits custom tooling (12+ week lead times)
**Risk:** HIGH - Limits actuator technology options
**Test Plan:** Architecture selection in v1.3.0
- Evaluate only COTS-available actuators (piezo, solenoid, SMA from standard suppliers)
- Document custom fabrication as "out of scope" for 2-month constraint

---

## High-Risk Assumptions

### ASMP-PWR-001: Power Strategy
**What PDF Says:** "portable companion device"
**What We Assume:** Internal rechargeable Li-ion/LiPo battery (3.7V, 2000-3000mAh)
**Why:** True portability = untethered. Rechargeable Li-ion is modern standard (smartphones, tablets, BrailleMe competitor). Best energy density (200 Wh/kg vs 100 Wh/kg for AA/AAA).
**Risk:** HIGH - Fundamentally changes architecture
**Alternatives & Impacts:**
- **Alt A: USB-C parasitic power only** (no battery)
  - Pro: -$8-12 BOM, -50g weight, simpler (no charging circuit/BMS)
  - Con: Tethered to phone, defeats "portable" vision, cable management for blind users
- **Alt B: Replaceable AA/AAA cells** (3×AAA ≈ 1350mAh)
  - Pro: User-replaceable, no charging circuit, familiar
  - Con: 2x weight for same capacity, +20-30% enclosure size, lower power density
- **Alt C: Rechargeable Li-ion** ✅ BASELINE
  - Pro: Smallest/lightest, highest energy density, modern UX (USB-C charging)
  - Con: +$8-12 BOM, requires charging circuit + BMS, Li-ion safety compliance
**Test Plan:** v1.3.0 architectures will compare all 3 power strategies

### ASMP-COMM-001: Connectivity Strategy
**What PDF Says:** "compatible with cell phone"
**What We Assume:** BLE 5.0+ primary (wireless), USB-C secondary (charging + fallback data)
**Why:** "Portable companion" suggests wireless freedom. BLE is universal (iOS/Android). USB-C provides charging + wired fallback if BLE fails.
**Risk:** HIGH - Affects BOM, power budget, UX, enclosure
**Alternatives & Impacts:**
- **Alt A: BLE-only** (no USB data, wireless charging only)
  - Pro: Simpler, -$3-5 BOM (no USB controller)
  - Con: No wired fallback, wireless charging adds cost/complexity
- **Alt B: USB-C only** (wired data + parasitic power)
  - Pro: Simplest, no battery needed, lowest BOM
  - Con: Tethered (defeats portability), cable management for blind users
- **Alt C: BLE + USB-C hybrid** ✅ BASELINE
  - Pro: Best UX (wireless primary, wired fallback), USB-C charging standard
  - Con: Highest BOM (+$3-5 for USB), more complex firmware
**Test Plan:** v1.3.0 architectures will compare BLE-only, USB-only, hybrid

---

## Medium-Risk Assumptions

### ASMP-PWR-002: Battery Life Target
**Assumption:** ≥8 hours continuous use
**Alternatives:** 4 hours (smaller battery, -30% cost) or 16 hours (2x battery, +50% cost/weight)
**Impact:** Affects battery size, weight, cost
**Test Plan:** Power budget calculations in v1.4.0

### ASMP-PWR-003: Battery Service Life
**Assumption:** ≥500 charge cycles (≈2 years @ daily charging, ≈5 years @ weekly charging)
**Alternatives:** 1000+ cycles (premium battery, +$1-2) or replaceable design (enclosure complexity)
**Impact:** Lifecycle cost, warranty strategy
**Test Plan:** Battery selection in v1.3.0, lifecycle cost in v1.4.0

### ASMP-MFG-002: SMT Assembly
**Assumption:** Automated SMT assembly for high-volume
**Alternative:** Through-hole easier for prototyping
**Impact:** SMT enables volume scaling, through-hole limits to <1K/year
**Test Plan:** DFM analysis in v1.5.0

## Low-Risk Assumptions

### ASMP-BRAILLE-001: Braille Dot Dimensions
**What Standards Say:** US ADA 703.3: 1.5-1.6mm diameter, 0.64-0.94mm height
**What We Assume:** 1.5mm diameter, 0.6mm height, hemispherical dome
**Why:** Standards are clear and consistent. Targeting mid-range for broad compliance (US + Australia + BANA).
**Risk:** LOW - Standards well-established and legally mandated (US ADA)
**Flexibility:**
- Diameter: 1.4-1.6 mm acceptable (tight tolerance)
- Height: 0.5-0.7 mm acceptable (can optimize for actuator)
- Shape: Hemispherical preferred, rounded dome acceptable
**Test Plan:** Actuator selection in v1.3.0, mechanical measurement + user testing in v1.5.0
**Reference:** `reference/standards/braille-dimensions-standards.md`

### ASMP-BRAILLE-002: Braille Spacing
**What Standards Say:** US ADA: 2.3-2.5mm dot pitch, 6.1-7.6mm cell pitch
**What We Assume:** 2.5mm dot pitch (within cell), 6.0mm cell pitch (between cells)
**Why:** Standards are clear. 2.5mm dot pitch is upper limit (easier manufacturing). 6.0mm cell pitch is lower limit (compact design).
**Risk:** LOW - Standards well-established
**Implications:**
- 32 characters × 6.0mm = **192mm display width**
- Plus margins: ~200-210mm total device width
- Validates ASMP-SIZE-001 (≤20cm width is tight fit!)
**Test Plan:** CAD layout in v1.3.0, mechanical verification in v1.5.0
**Reference:** `reference/standards/braille-dimensions-standards.md`

---

### ASMP-MARKET-001: Multi-Region Compliance Strategy
**What PDF Says:** (nothing - market not specified)
**What We Assume:** Target multi-region (US/EU/China/India) for broadest market access
**Why:** Unknown market → design for broadest compliance envelope (most restrictive wins). Prevents rework if market expands.
**Risk:** HIGH - Drives compliance requirements
**Alternatives & Impacts:**
- **Alt A: US-only** → FCC only, simpler, but limits market
- **Alt B: EU-only** → CE only, different battery standards
- **Alt C: China-only** → CCC, SRRC (different process)
- **Alt D: Multi-region** ✅ → Design once, test multiple (higher initial awareness, but broader access)
**Test Plan:** v1.5.0 identifies all regional standards (FCC/CE/CCC), design awareness, post-pilot testing

---

### ASMP-COMPLIANCE-001: Compliance Approach
**What We Assume:** Design awareness now, formal certification testing post-pilot
**Why:** 2-month timeline prohibits full certification (12-16 weeks for FCC/CE/CCC testing). Design smart now, test later.
**Risk:** MEDIUM - If design fails testing post-pilot, rework is costly
**Mitigation:** Follow best practices (EMC layout, pre-certified BLE module, BMS for battery), reduces risk of test failure
**Test Plan:** v1.5.0 production plan includes post-pilot certification timeline

---

## Medium-Risk Assumptions

### ASMP-CELLS-001: 32-Cell Display Count
**What PDF Says:** "32 characters"
**What We Assume:** 32 cells is firm requirement (not negotiable to 20-cell standard)
**Why:** PDF explicitly states 32. Competitors use 20-cell (BrailleMe, Orbit Reader). 32-cell = differentiation but higher cost.
**Risk:** MEDIUM - 60% more actuators than standard (32 vs 20 = 192 dots vs 120 dots)
**Alternatives:**
- If 20-cell acceptable → -40% actuators, -$15-20 BOM, matches market standard
- If 40-cell required → +25% actuators, +$10-15 BOM, larger enclosure
**Test Plan:** Sensitivity analysis in v1.4.0 (cost impact of 20 vs 32 vs 40 cells)

### ASMP-WEIGHT-001: Weight Target
**What PDF Says:** "portable"
**What We Assume:** ≤1.3 lbs (590g) based on BrailleMe benchmark
**Why:** BrailleMe (20-cell) = 1.3 lbs. Our 32-cell design = 60% more actuators, so same or slightly heavier is reasonable.
**Risk:** MEDIUM - ASMP-SIZE-001 said ≤200g (too aggressive for 32-cell with battery)
**Revised Target:** ≤590g (1.3 lbs) more realistic for 32-cell + battery + enclosure
**Test Plan:** Weight budget in v1.3.0 (actuators + battery + PCB + enclosure)

### ASMP-IFACE-001: Multi-Interface Support
**What PDF Says:** "compatible with cell phone"
**What We Assume:** BLE + USB-C (hybrid), optional SD card like BrailleMe
**Why:** BrailleMe offers BLE + USB + SD card. More interfaces = better compatibility but higher cost (+$5-10 BOM).
**Risk:** MEDIUM - Adds complexity, cost, but improves UX
**Alternatives:**
- BLE-only → -$5 BOM, simpler
- USB-C only → No battery, tethered
- BLE + USB-C ✅ → Best flexibility
- BLE + USB-C + SD → Like BrailleMe, +$3-5 more
**Test Plan:** v1.3.0 interface architecture comparison, v1.4.0 cost analysis

---

### Other Low-Risk Assumptions

### ASMP-UX-001: Auto-Sleep Feature
**What We Assume:** Auto-sleep (no power button), wake on button press or BLE activity
**Why:** BrailleMe uses auto-sleep. Reduces button count (-$0.50-1.00 BOM), simpler UX for blind users.
**Risk:** LOW - Standard practice, easy to implement
**Test Plan:** UX design in v1.3.0, power budget in v1.4.0

These assumptions are either:
- Explicitly stated in PDF (ASMP-STD-001, ASMP-TIME-001)
- Industry standard practice (ASMP-MFG-001, ASMP-ENV-001, ASMP-UX-001)
- Minimal impact if wrong (ASMP-USER-001, ASMP-PWR-003)

## Linking Assumptions → Requirements

**Requirements that depend on assumptions:**

| Requirement | Depends On Assumption | Impact |
|-------------|----------------------|--------|
| ASMP-COST-001 (BOM target) | ASMP-COST-001 | If $30 target, eliminates architectures; if $100, enables premium options |
| ASMP-VOL-001 (Volume target) | ASMP-VOL-001 | If 1K/year, hand assembly OK; if 100K/year, requires full automation |
| ASMP-SIZE-001 (Portability) | ASMP-SIZE-001 | If smaller required, limits battery; if larger OK, eases PCB routing |
| ASMP-PWR-002 (Battery life) | ASMP-PWR-001, ASMP-PWR-002 | If Li-ion, need charging circuit; if AAA, larger enclosure; if USB-C, no battery |
| EE-COMM-001 (Interface) | ASMP-COMM-001 | If BLE-only, -$5 BOM; if USB-only, tethered; if hybrid, best UX but costly |
| SYS-MECH-001 (Dot dimensions) | ASMP-BRAILLE-001 | Actuator must achieve 0.5-0.7mm stroke, 1.5mm tip diameter |
| SYS-MECH-002 (Dot spacing) | ASMP-BRAILLE-002 | 2.5mm pitch = tight spacing, actuators must be compact (192mm width for 32 chars) |
| SYS-MECH-003 (Holding force) | ASMP-BRAILLE-003 | Actuator must provide ≥50g force, affects power/cost trade-off |
