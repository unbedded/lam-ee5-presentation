## Key Speaker Notes to Memorize

### Slide 3: Problem Statement ‚≠ê CRITICAL
```
"I read the spec CAREFULLY and extracted requirements."
"6 of 9 are vague - I need YOUR feedback before building the wrong thing."
"What you asked is NOT POSSIBLE in 2 months without trade-offs."
```

**Purpose:** Sets up honest engineering conversation, justifies portfolio approach

### Slide 5: Market Context
```
"$515-$2,199 USD range for 20-40 chars"
"100% piezo monopoly, 8-12 week lead time"
"Our 32 chars @ $600 USD fills market gap"
```

**Purpose:** Establishes commercial reality and competitive positioning

### Slide 13: EMI Challenge ‚≠ê SENIOR EE DIFFERENTIATOR
```
"30mm cantilever = Œª/4 monopole @ 1.67 GHz"
"Piezo pays 2.5√ó EMI cost premium BUT gets 1.6√ó faster refresh"
```

**Purpose:** Shows GHz antenna physics understanding (senior-level knowledge)

### Slide 19: Decision Framework ‚≠ê KEY MESSAGE
```
"No 'best' architecture, only 'best FOR YOUR CONSTRAINTS'"
"Give me your priorities, I'll tell you which architecture wins"
```

**Purpose:** Demonstrates systems thinking and customer-centric design

### Slide 21: Actuator Sourcing ‚≠ê ELEPHANT IN ROOM
```
"THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM - must address head-on"
"No COTS solution exists today"
"$50K contingency for custom actuator NRE"
"Decision point: End of Week 2"
```

**Purpose:** Shows honest risk assessment and mitigation planning

## Practice Workflow (5 Days to Interview)

### Days 5-4 (Today-Tomorrow): Content Mastery
- ‚úÖ Generate PPTX: `make pptx`
- ‚úÖ Print Notes Pages: File ‚Üí Print ‚Üí "Notes Pages" (1 slide/page)
- ‚úÖ Practice in Presenter View: Time each section (aim for ~60 sec/slide)
- ‚úÖ Identify 5 key messages above - MEMORIZE those talking points

### Days 3-2: Delivery Practice
- ‚úÖ Full run-through WITHOUT looking at notes (test internalization)
- ‚úÖ Record yourself (audio/video) - identify weak spots
- ‚úÖ Practice Q&A with appendix slides (be ready to jump to backup)
- ‚úÖ Time transitions between sections

### Day 1: Final Prep
- ‚úÖ Final run-through with notes (smooth delivery)
- ‚úÖ Print backup: Notes Pages (2 pages/sheet, landscape, grayscale)
- ‚úÖ Triple backup: USB drive + laptop + email PPTX to yourself

### Interview Day: Checklist
- ‚úÖ Printed notes nearby (don't rely on tech)
- ‚úÖ Load PPTX on interview computer (test Presenter View works)
- ‚úÖ Glance at notes for transitions, NOT full reading
- ‚úÖ Use appendix slides for deep technical Q&A

## Files Generated (Your "SPEAKER Version")

**Source (Markdown with speaker notes):**
```
source/presentation-slides.md
```

**Generated PPTX (with embedded notes):**
```
source/presentation.pptx
```

**Documentation:**
```
docs/presentation-speaker-notes-guide.md    (Full guide - 400 lines)
docs/speaker-notes-quick-reference.md      (This card)
```

**How to regenerate:**
```bash
make pptx  # Converts Markdown ‚Üí PPTX with notes
```

## Verification: Speaker Notes Are Working

‚úÖ **Verified:** All 29 main slides have speaker notes
‚úÖ **Verified:** All 8 appendix slides have speaker notes
‚úÖ **Verified:** Notes are embedded in `ppt/notesSlides/notesSlide*.xml`
‚úÖ **Verified:** Pandoc converts `:::notes` blocks to PowerPoint format

**Test yourself:**
```bash
# Count notes files in PPTX (should be 37)
unzip -l source/presentation.pptx | grep -c "notesSlide"
```

## Key Numbers to Remember (From Speaker Notes)

- **32 characters = 192 dots** (6 dots/char standard + 2 extended)
- **$600 USD retail, $200 USD BOM target** ($6.25/cell)
- **2-month timeline = COTS mandate** (‚â§4 week lead time)
- **100% of commercial displays use custom piezo** (8-12 week lead)
- **30mm piezo cantilever = Œª/4 antenna @ 1.67 GHz** (EMI challenge)
- **68 dB EMI reduction from firmware alone** ($0 hardware cost)
- **$50K NRE budget for custom actuator quickturn** (risk mitigation)
- **3 architectures, no universal "best"** (depends on priorities)

## Q&A Prep (From Slide 29 Speaker Notes)

### Anticipated Questions:
1. **Why can't you find COTS actuators?**
   ‚Üí "2.5mm pitch is non-standard, most displays use 200V custom piezos"

2. **What if timeline extends to 4 months?**
   ‚Üí "Opens door to custom actuator standard lead time, better cost optimization"

3. **Which architecture would YOU pick?**
   ‚Üí "ARCH_PIEZO_ECO most robust, but depends on wireless requirement"

4. **Can you hit $200 BOM?**
   ‚Üí "Not with COTS, need volume negotiation or custom actuator design"

5. **Power supply design for 200V piezo?**
   ‚Üí "DC-DC boost converter, see appendix slides for EMI deep-dive"

### Deep Technical Backup:
- **Appendix A-G:** EMI physics, budget analysis, mitigation layers
- **If asked about GHz antenna:** Jump to Appendix A (Œª/4 resonance derivation)
- **If asked about EMI cost:** Jump to Appendix D (2.5√ó premium breakdown)

- ‚úÖ PPTX on USB drive (tech backup)
- ‚úÖ Can deliver WITHOUT slides (elevator pitch version)

## Final Confidence Check

**Before interview, ask yourself:**

1. Can I explain the problem in 30 seconds? ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí "32-char braille display, 2-month timeline, COTS mandate, $200 BOM target"

2. Can I name 3 architectures in 15 seconds? ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí "PIEZO_ECO (fast), SOL_ECO (cheap), PIEZO_DLX (wireless)"

3. Can I explain decision framework in 20 seconds? ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí "No universal 'best' - depends on your priorities: wireless? cost? timeline?"

4. Can I state THE critical risk in 10 seconds? ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí "Actuator sourcing - no COTS solution exists, $50K NRE mitigation budget"

5. Can I answer "Why should we hire YOU?" in 30 seconds? ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí "I don't sell perfect solutions - I navigate trade-offs, manage risks, and provide decision frameworks. I understood GHz EMI physics, caught the actuator sourcing gap, and built a portfolio approach because requirements were vague. That's senior EE thinking."
