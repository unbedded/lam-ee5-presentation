# ‚òÄÔ∏è Morning Briefing - 2025-10-08

**Good morning!** Here's what happened while you were sleeping.

---

## TL;DR (30 seconds)

‚úÖ **Requirements refactor complete** - Single source of truth established
‚úÖ **Professional documents generated** - requirements.md (34KB), cheat sheet, summaries
‚úÖ **Phase v1.2.0 nearly complete** - Only audit + phase gate left
‚úÖ **Time tracking: 13.0 hours logged** - AHEAD of schedule (6.5 hrs/day > 6.0 target)

**Next:** Review generated docs, run `/req-audit`, proceed to v1.3.0 Architecture Design

---

## What Was Completed (Autonomous Overnight Work)

### 1. Updated `/req-yaml-to-md` Slash Command
- Adapted for hierarchical PRD naming (PRD-SCHED-001, PRD-COST-001-ASMP, etc.)
- Extracts risk levels, sensitivity ranges, customer validation flags
- **File:** `.claude/commands/req-yaml-to-md.md`

### 2. Generated `artifacts/requirements.md` (34KB)
- **Executive Summary:** 15 requirements, risk breakdown, validation tracker
- **Full Catalog:** All 9 ground truth + 6 assumptions with rationale
- **Standards Compliance:** ADA braille specs, FCC/CE/UL awareness
- **Customer Validation Tracker:** 6 assumptions flagged for review
- **Phase Gate Checklist:** Next steps to freeze requirements

### 3. Created Helper Documents
- **`artifacts/NIGHT-WORK-SUMMARY.md`** - Detailed work log
- **`artifacts/REQUIREMENTS-CHEAT-SHEET.md`** - Quick reference guide
- **`MORNING-BRIEFING.md`** - This file

### 4. Updated Time Tracking
- Added 1.0h autonomous work session
- Total: 13.0 hours (13/84 = 15.5% complete)
- Pace: 6.5 hrs/day (ahead of 6.0 target)

---

## Files to Review (Priority Order)

### 1. üî• `artifacts/NIGHT-WORK-SUMMARY.md` (READ FIRST)
**Why:** Complete detailed summary of night work, key insights, questions to consider

### 2. üìã `artifacts/requirements.md` (34KB - Take Your Time)
**Why:** This is the professional requirements document - interview-ready

### 3. üìù `artifacts/REQUIREMENTS-CHEAT-SHEET.md` (Quick Reference)
**Why:** All requirements in one page, standards, cost breakdown, workflow

### 4. ‚úÖ `source/requirements.yaml` (v2.0.0 - Verify)
**Why:** Single source of truth - make sure refactor looks good

---

## Key Insights from Night Work

### 1. USB-C Wired is a Valid Low-Cost Option! üöÄ

**PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP explicitly documents this:**
- Architecture B: USB-C wired, no battery, **$100-150 BOM savings**
- Tethered to phone = still portable, just less convenient
- Great option for cost-sensitive markets

**Portfolio Approach:**
- Architecture A: BLE wireless ($200-250 BOM)
- Architecture B: USB-C wired ($100-150 BOM) ‚Üê **lowest cost!**
- Architecture C: Hybrid BLE+USB ($250-300 BOM)

### 2. 67% of Requirements are VAGUE ‚Üí Need Customer Validation

| Requirement | Risk Level | Needs Validation |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| PRD-COST-001-ASMP | CRITICAL | ‚úÖ YES |
| PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP | HIGH | ‚úÖ YES |
| PRD-VOL-001-ASMP | HIGH | ‚úÖ YES |
| PRD-SCHED-001-ASMP | MEDIUM | ‚úÖ YES |
| PRD-SIZE-001-ASMP | MEDIUM | ‚úÖ YES |
| PRD-FUNC-002-ASMP | MEDIUM | ‚úÖ YES |

**Critical Question:** Can you validate assumptions with LAM before interview?

### 3. v1.4.0 Sensitivity Analysis Will Test All Scenarios

Instead of guessing, we'll design portfolio and test:
- **Cost scenarios:** $100, $150, $200, $250, $300 BOM
- **Volume scenarios:** 1k, 10k, 100k units/month
- **Interface scenarios:** BLE-only vs USB-C vs hybrid
- **Timeline scenarios:** Pilot (100-500) vs mass production

Let v1.4.0 trade-off analysis rank them objectively.

---

## Questions to Consider (Over Coffee ‚òï)

### 1. Cost Assumption
**Current:** $200 BOM ¬±$100 (range: $100-$300)

**Question:** Does this feel right? Or should we target:
- More aggressive: $150 BOM (retail ~$450)
- More conservative: $250 BOM (retail ~$750)

**Impact:** Drives entire architecture selection (actuators, battery, interface)

### 2. USB-C Wired Option Priority
**Current:** Architecture B (one of three options)

**Question:** Should we prioritize USB-C wired as Architecture A (baseline)?
- **Pros:** Lowest cost ($100-150 BOM), simplest design, no battery complexity
- **Cons:** Tethered (less portable), lower UX vs wireless

**Market fit:** Cost-sensitive (India/China) vs premium (US/EU)

### 3. Pilot Production Interpretation
**Current assumption:** 2 months = 100-500 unit pilot

**Question:** Does PDF really mean pilot? Or mass production?
- If pilot: Current plan is correct
- If mass production: Timeline is **infeasible** (tooling takes 8-12 weeks)

**Validation needed:** Can you clarify with LAM?

### 4. Volume Target
**Current assumption:** 10k units/month (120k/year)

**Question:** Is this realistic "high volume"?
- Low volume: 1k/month (hand assembly OK)
- Mid volume: 10k/month (SMT, automated testing)
- High volume: 100k/month (full automation, high NRE)

**Impact:** DFM decisions, component selection, NRE vs unit cost

## Immediate Next Steps (This Morning)

### Step 1: Review Generated Documents (30-45 min)
- [ ] Read `artifacts/NIGHT-WORK-SUMMARY.md`
- [ ] Review `artifacts/requirements.md`
- [ ] Skim `artifacts/REQUIREMENTS-CHEAT-SHEET.md`

### Step 2: Validate Requirements Structure (5 min)
```bash
/req-audit
```
**Expected output:** Validation report (all checks pass)

### Step 3: Git Commit (5 min)
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "feat(v1.2.0): Refactor requirements with hierarchical PRD naming

- Extract 9 ground truth requirements from PDF (PRD-XXXX-NNN)
- Create 6 assumptions for vague requirements (PRD-XXXX-NNN-ASMP)
- Rewrite requirements.yaml as single source of truth (v2.0.0)
- Generate requirements.md (34KB) with TOC, summaries, risk analysis
- Create cheat sheet and overnight work summary
- Update /req-yaml-to-md slash command for PRD naming
- Log 3.5h total (2.5h refactor + 1.0h transforms)

BREAKING CHANGE: Old naming scheme (SYS-*, EE-*, MFG-*) replaced with
hierarchical PRD naming (PRD-SCHED-001, PRD-COST-001-ASMP, etc.)

git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Phase Gate Decision (10 min)
**Question:** Are requirements ready to freeze?

**Checklist:**
- [x] 9 ground truth requirements extracted
- [x] 6 assumptions documented
- [x] Single source of truth (requirements.yaml v2.0.0)
- [x] Professional documentation (requirements.md)
- [ ] Audit validation (`/req-audit`)
- [ ] Customer review (optional, if possible)
- [ ] **FREEZE requirements.yaml**

**If YES:** Proceed to v1.3.0 Architecture Design
**If NO:** What needs refinement?

### Step 5: Move to v1.3.0 (If Phase Gate Passes)
**Goal:** Design portfolio of 3-4 architectures

**Architectures:**
1. Architecture A: BLE wireless ($200-250 BOM)
2. Architecture B: USB-C wired ($100-150 BOM)
3. Architecture C: Hybrid BLE+USB ($250-300 BOM)
4. (Optional) Architecture D: Premium ($300+ BOM)

**Key decisions:**
- Actuator technology: Piezo, solenoid, SMA, voice coil
- Microcontroller: STM32, ESP32, nRF52, RP2040
- I/O expansion: Shift registers, I2C GPIO, mux
- Power: Li-ion, AA/AAA, USB-C parasitic

**Cumulative:**
- **Total logged:** 13.0 hours (15.5% of 84h budget)
- **Total remaining:** 71.0 hours
- **Days elapsed:** 2 days (Oct 7-8)
- **Days remaining:** 15 days (until Oct 23 interview)

**Phase progress:**
- v0.1.0 (Project Setup): 4.5h / 3h est (150% - over, but acceptable)
- v1.1.0 (Quality Metrics): 2.0h / 3h est (67% - under budget)
- v1.2.0 (Requirements Analysis): 5.5h / 6h est (92% - nearly complete)
- v4.x (EE Skills Prep): 1.0h / 18h est (6% - early start)

**Recommendation:** On pace, continue current workflow

## Potential Issues / Risks

### 1. Customer Validation Not Available
**Issue:** 6 assumptions need validation, but no LAM contact until interview

**Mitigation:**
- v1.4.0 sensitivity analysis tests all scenarios
- Present portfolio (not single design) at interview
- Show trade-offs explicitly (cost vs UX vs timeline)

### 2. Cost Assumption May Be Too Aggressive
**Issue:** $200 BOM might be unrealistic for 32-cell device

**Mitigation:**
- v1.3.0 designs architectures at $100, $150, $200, $250, $300
- v1.4.0 ranks them by feasibility + cost
- If $200 infeasible, fall back to $250 or $300

### 3. Timeline May Be Misinterpreted
**Issue:** PDF says "production in 2 months" - pilot or mass?

**Mitigation:**
- Current assumption: Pilot (100-500 units)
- If wrong: Timeline is infeasible (acknowledge risk)
- v1.5.0 production plan shows both paths
