## Continuous Quality Monitoring

### Use `/rubric-eval` After Each Phase

Run evaluation after completing each phase:
- v1.2.0: `/rubric-eval` → Check Category 1 score
- v1.3.0: `/rubric-eval` → Check Category 2 score
- v1.4.0: `/rubric-eval` → Check Category 3 score (highest weight!)
- v1.5.0: `/rubric-eval` → Check Category 4 score

**Red Flags (require immediate action):**
- Any category <80% threshold
- Overall score <85/100 at v1.6.0
