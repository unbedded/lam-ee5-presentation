# ⚠️ CRITICAL DEADLINES - DO NOT MISS

## The 24-Hour Rule

**MOST IMPORTANT:** Presentation must be **EMAILED 24 HOURS BEFORE INTERVIEW**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Interview Date: October 23, 2025                       │
│  Presentation Due: OCTOBER 22, 2025 (BY END OF DAY)     │
│  Email To: Nathan Briggs (recruiting contact)           │
│  USB NOT SUPPORTED - Email only!                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this catches people:**
- They think "I have until interview day"
- **WRONG!** You lose the last 24 hours
- Late submission = No presentation = Failed interview

## What Happens If You Miss The Deadline?

**Scenario 1: Email at 9am Oct 23 (interview day)**
- ❌ Too late - security policy requires 24hr advance
- ❌ No digital content allowed in interview
- ❌ You present from memory only (disaster)
- ❌ Likely fail interview

**Scenario 2: Email at 11pm Oct 22 (last minute but on time)**
- ✅ Meets deadline
- ⚠️ No time to fix if recruiter can't open file
- ⚠️ No time to re-send if attachment bounces
- ⚠️ Risky but acceptable

**Scenario 3: Email at 2pm Oct 22 (recommended)**
- ✅ Meets deadline with buffer
- ✅ Time to fix issues if recruiter responds
- ✅ Professional impression
- ✅ BEST PRACTICE

**Scenario 4: Email at 5pm Oct 21 (early bird)**
- ✅ Exceeds expectations
- ✅ Full day buffer for issues
- ✅ Shows preparedness
- ✅ IDEAL

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Problem: "What if my email bounces?"
**Solution:** Send to yourself first, verify attachments open correctly, then forward to Nathan.

### Problem: "What if files are too large?"
**Solution:**
- Compress images in PowerPoint (Picture Tools → Compress)
- Export PDF with "Standard" quality (not "High")
- Target: <10MB PDF, <15MB PPTX

### Problem: "What if Nathan doesn't acknowledge receipt?"
**Solution:**
- Send follow-up email 2 hours later
- Call recruiting contact if no response by 6pm Oct 22
- Have backup plan (printed slides)

### Problem: "What if I find a typo after sending?"
**Solution:**
- If found on Oct 22 morning → resend corrected version
- If found on Oct 22 evening → too late, live with it
- If found on Oct 23 → mention verbally during presentation

---

## Success Criteria for Oct 22

**By end of day Oct 22, you must have:**
- ✅ Email sent to Nathan Briggs
- ✅ Attachments: presentation.pdf + presentation.pptx
- ✅ Files <25MB total
- ✅ Files tested on Windows + Mac
- ✅ Email in Sent folder (proof of delivery)
- ✅ No typos, broken links, missing images
- ✅ Slides render correctly

**If ANY of these are missing, you have a problem.**

---

## Why This Matters

**From PDF p.8:**
> "Important: You may present digital content during your interview, however
> due to Lam security policies, this content must be emailed to your recruiting
> contact at least 24 hours prior to the interview. USB drives are NOT supported."

**Translation:**
- Security policy = NO EXCEPTIONS
- 24 hours = HARD DEADLINE
- USB not supported = EMAIL IS YOUR ONLY OPTION
- Miss this = No presentation = Fail interview

**This is non-negotiable. Don't test it.**
