## Technical-Debt

### EMI Cost-Down Optimization (Post-Pilot)
- **Purpose:** Reduce EMI component costs from "pass with >6dB margin" to "pass with target margin (3dB)"
- **Rationale:** Current low-risk design uses conservative EMI suppression (1000¬µF bulk caps, 100nF bypass on every IC) to ensure pilot passes preliminary testing on first attempt. Post-pilot, optimize to "just good enough" based on actual measured emissions.
- **Cost reduction opportunities:**
  - **Bulk capacitors:** 1000¬µF ‚Üí 470¬µF or 220¬µF (reduce by 50-75%) ‚Üí Save $1.20-$1.80
  - **Ceramic bypass:** 100nF on all 24 ICs ‚Üí Selectively place only on high-noise drivers ‚Üí Save $0.12-$0.18
  - **Zener clamps:** Currently using ULN2803A internal flyback (free), could add zeners for faster decay if needed (cost neutral)
  - **Ferrite beads:** Currently not in BOM, add only if pre-scan shows >3dB margin violations ‚Üí $0.50 adder if needed
- **Measurement-driven approach:**
  1. Week 7 pilot: EMI pre-scan with spectrum analyzer (baseline measurements)
  2. Identify worst-case emissions (conducted vs radiated, which frequencies)
  3. If >10dB margin: Reduce capacitance by 50% and re-test (cost-down iteration)
  4. If 3-6dB margin: Keep current design (optimal)
  5. If <3dB margin: Add targeted fixes (ferrite beads on specific rails, zener clamps on specific solenoids)
- **Target savings:** $1.50-$2.00 per unit (0.6-0.8% BOM reduction)
- **Risk:** LOW (only optimize after pilot validates baseline design works)
- **Status:** Deferred to Month 3-4 (post-pilot, pre-production volume ramp)
- **Philosophy:** **"Design for standards compliance with margin, then cost-down to target margin"** (not "design minimum and hope it passes")

### Future Slash Command: /arch-tradeoff
- **Purpose:** Generate trade-off analysis documentation from architectures.yaml
- **Rationale:** Separate concerns - /arch-gen focuses on individual architecture details, /arch-tradeoff focuses on comparison/evaluation
- **Reference template:** `docs/_obsolete/architecture-v1.3.0-4arch-manual.md` (22KB strategic analysis with advantages/disadvantages, "When X Wins/Fails", recommendations)
- **Target output:** `docs/tradeoffs.md` (manually edited strategic analysis)
- **Generated artifacts:**
  - `artifacts/architecture-comparison-matrix.md` (quantitative tables - MOVE from /arch-gen)
  - `artifacts/architecture-qualitative-comparison.md` (qualitative ratings across 8 dimensions)
  - `artifacts/architecture-advantages-disadvantages.md` (pros/cons extracted from qualitative YAML data)
  - `artifacts/architecture-decision-trees.md` ("When X Wins/Fails" logic based on quantitative thresholds)
  - `artifacts/architecture-recommendations.md` (portfolio strategy, cost reduction roadmap)
- **Implementation approach:**
  - Read source/architectures.yaml (comparison_dimensions + qualitative/quantitative sections)
  - Generate comparison tables (cost, size, UX, complexity, timeline, mfg, risk, market)
  - Extract advantages from qualitative ratings (üíö BEST/EXCELLENT ‚Üí advantages, üî¥ POOR/FAIR ‚Üí disadvantages)
  - Generate "When X Wins" decision trees from quantitative thresholds (e.g., "if timeline < 7 weeks ‚Üí ARCH-B wins")
  - Generate "When X Fails" from constraints (e.g., "if budget < $300 ‚Üí ARCH-A fails")
  - Keep strategic recommendations in docs/tradeoffs.md (manual)
- **Content mapping from obsolete template:**
  - Section "Advantages" ‚Üí Extract from qualitative üíö ratings
  - Section "Disadvantages" ‚Üí Extract from qualitative üî¥ ratings
  - Section "When X Wins" ‚Üí Generate from quantitative thresholds
  - Section "When X Fails" ‚Üí Generate from constraint violations
  - Section "Trade-Off Analysis Summary" ‚Üí Weighted scoring (manual in docs/tradeoffs.md)
  - Section "Recommendations" ‚Üí Portfolio strategy (manual in docs/tradeoffs.md)
- **Benefit:** /arch-gen stays focused on subsystem details and specs, /arch-tradeoff handles evaluation logic
- **Status:** Deferred to post-interview (not blocking v1.4.0 Trade-off Analysis - can write manually)

### Documentation Structure Clarification
- **docs/_obsolete/architecture-v1.3.0-4arch-manual.md** - OBSOLETE v1.3.0 strategic analysis (moved before renaming + 5th arch)
- **docs/_obsolete/actuator-mechanical-latch-concept-v1.3.0.md** - OBSOLETE latch concept (specific to old ARCH-D design)
- **artifacts/architecture.md** - Technical reference with subsystem details (auto-generated via /arch-gen)
- **artifacts/architecture-comparison-matrix.md** - Quantitative comparison tables (auto-generated, currently by /arch-gen)
- **docs/tradeoffs.md** - Strategic trade-off analysis (v1.4.0, manually written)
- **docs/solution.md** - Recommended solution with justification (v1.5.0, manually written)
- Future: /arch-tradeoff command will auto-generate advantages/disadvantages, decision trees from YAML

### Enhanced Requirements Traceability Analysis
- **Purpose:** Create comprehensive coverage matrix showing which requirements each architecture satisfies
- **Plan:** See [docs/requirements-trace-plan.md](docs/requirements-trace-plan.md) for complete implementation details
- **Priority:** P1-High (affects traceability rubric score)
- **Effort:** 2-3 hours (Python script enhancement)
- **Status:** Deferred to post-interview
