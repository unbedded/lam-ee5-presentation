<summary><strong>Original v1.4.0 Plan (Collapsed - Already Complete via EMI Analysis)</strong></summary>

**Guide:** See [docs/tradeoff-analysis-guide.md](docs/tradeoff-analysis-guide.md) for complete methodology

**Quality Metrics:** See [docs/quality-metrics.md](docs/quality-metrics.md) v1.4.0 section for gate criteria

**Step 1: Define Evaluation Criteria (What Do We VALUE?)**
- [ ] Define evaluation framework based on design context:
  - [ ] **Context:** 2-month pilot production for China accessibility market
  - [ ] **Stakeholder priorities:** (ASSUME since not specified)
    - [ ] Time to market (CRITICAL - 2 month constraint)
    - [ ] Unit cost (HIGH - China market price sensitivity)
    - [ ] Development cost/NRE (MEDIUM - pilot budget limited)
    - [ ] Manufacturability/yield (HIGH - pilot ‚Üí mass production)
    - [ ] Robustness/reliability (MEDIUM - accessibility device)
    - [ ] UX/usability (HIGH - sight-impaired users)
    - [ ] Safety (MEDIUM - low voltage, battery powered)
  - [ ] **Assumption documentation:** Explicitly state what was assumed and why
  - [ ] **Weighted scoring matrix:** Assign weights to each criterion (must sum to 100%)
- [ ] Example evaluation matrix structure:
  ```
  Criterion              | Weight | Arch A | Arch B | Arch C | Notes
  -----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------
  Time to Market         | 25%    | 7/10   | 9/10   | 5/10   | B fastest (COTS parts)
  Unit Cost (<$50 BOM)   | 20%    | 6/10   | 8/10   | 4/10   | B lowest cost
  Dev Cost (<$50K NRE)   | 10%    | 5/10   | 9/10   | 3/10   | A needs custom tooling
  Manufacturability      | 20%    | 8/10   | 7/10   | 6/10   | ARCH_PIEZO_ECO: simpler DFM
  Robustness/Reliability | 10%    | 7/10   | 6/10   | 8/10   | ARCH_PIEZO_DLX: more robust
  UX/Usability           | 10%    | 8/10   | 7/10   | 9/10   | ARCH_PIEZO_DLX: better tactile
  Safety                 | 5%     | 9/10   | 9/10   | 8/10   | All low voltage
  TOTAL SCORE            | 100%   | X.X    | X.X    | X.X    | Weighted average
  ```

**Step 2: Advantages & Disadvantages Analysis**
**‚ö†Ô∏è PDF REQUIREMENT:** "Discuss their advantages and disadvantages" (explicit in Step 3)

- [ ] For EACH architecture, document:
  - [ ] **Advantages** (strengths, what it does well - be specific with data)
  - [ ] **Disadvantages** (weaknesses, limitations, risks - be honest)
  - [ ] **When it wins** (under what conditions does this architecture excel?)
  - [ ] **When it fails** (under what conditions does this become unviable?)
- [ ] Create comparison table showing advantages/disadvantages side-by-side

**Step 3: Quantitative Comparison**
- [ ] **‚ö†Ô∏è ACTUATOR SOURCING RISK ANALYSIS (CRITICAL - affects ALL architectures)**
  - [ ] Document the crisis: NO COTS actuators found meeting 2.5mm pitch + force requirements
  - [ ] Create three-path analysis table (resources/calculations/actuator-sourcing-risk.xlsx)
    - Path A (COTS search): $5K cost, 2 weeks, 20% probability
    - Path B (Custom quickturn): $25K-50K NRE, 2-4 weeks, 90% probability
    - Path C (Spec relaxation): $0, 0 weeks, 100% probability (but violates ADA 703.3)
  - [ ] Timeline impact analysis: Best case (+0 wks), Likely case (+4 wks), Worst case (+8 wks)
  - [ ] Probability-weighted expected value: Timeline & NRE cost
  - [ ] **Key message:** "This is THE critical path risk - all architectures blocked without resolution"
- [ ] Create comparison matrix in resources/calculations/
  - [ ] Cost comparison (BOM estimates for each architecture)
  - [ ] Power budget calculations (actuators + MCU + communication)
  - [ ] Size/complexity metrics (component count, PCB area estimate)
  - [ ] Timeline feasibility (parts lead time, assembly complexity, actuator sourcing)
- [ ] Build resources/calculations/power-budget.xlsx
  - Calculate power for all 3 architectures
  - Battery life estimates
- [ ] Build resources/calculations/bom-cost-estimate.xlsx
  - Component costs (qty 1, qty 100, qty 1000)
  - Total BOM cost per architecture
- [ ] Build resources/calculations/timeline-gantt.xlsx
  - 2-month timeline with milestones
  - Critical path analysis
  - Risk buffers
- [ ] Assess manufacturability for high volume (DFM analysis)
- [ ] Risk analysis for each approach (technical, timeline, cost, supply chain)
- [ ] **‚ö†Ô∏è SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS (REQUIRED):**
  - [ ] "What if cost doubles?" - Which architecture is most robust?
  - [ ] "What if timeline compresses to 1 month?" - Which is fastest to implement?
  - [ ] "What if key component unavailable?" - Which has better supply chain alternates?
  - [ ] "What if volume targets change (1K vs 100K)?" - Which scales better?
  - [ ] Create sensitivity comparison matrix
- [ ] **"Other Considerations" Analysis:**
  - [ ] Supply chain availability (lead times, single-source risks)
  - [ ] Team expertise required (familiar vs new technology)
  - [ ] Tooling/equipment needs (what's available vs what to buy)
  - [ ] Risk tolerance (proven tech vs cutting edge)
  - [ ] Market timing considerations
- [ ] Create docs/tradeoffs.md with:
  - [ ] **Evaluation criteria framework** (what we value + weights)
  - [ ] **Assumptions documentation** (China market, pilot production, etc.)
  - [ ] **Advantages & disadvantages** for each architecture (honest assessment)
  - [ ] **Quantitative comparison** (cost, power, size, timeline - scored objectively)
  - [ ] **Weighted scoring results** (which architecture scores highest?)
  - [ ] **Sensitivity analysis** ("what if" scenarios - how evaluation changes)
  - [ ] **"Other considerations"** (supply chain, expertise, tooling)
  - [ ] **Portfolio strategy** showing when each architecture wins (decision framework based on constraints)
    - Example: "ARCH_PIEZO_ECO wins if cost < $450 AND timeline > 8 weeks"
    - Example: "ARCH_SOL_ECO wins if mechanical simplicity prioritized AND cost < $300"
    - Example: "ARCH_PIEZO_DLX wins if wireless required AND budget allows $450+"
- [ ] Run /rubric-eval for Category 3 assessment (Trade-off Analysis: 30 pts)
  - Generates artifacts/rubric-reports/v1.4.0-tradeoffs-eval.md

### <span style="color:red">v1.5.0: Production Transition Process (feature/tech-analysis-production)</span>
**Design Plan Alignment:** Complete Design Step 4 (PDF p.10) - 20/100 points

**Key Message:** "Same production process, but actuator sourcing is THE critical path risk"

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PATH RISK (SHARED ACROSS ALL ARCHITECTURES):**
- **Week 0-2: Actuator Sourcing Crisis Resolution**
  - [ ] Document the problem: NO COTS actuators found that meet 2.5mm pitch + force requirements
  - [ ] Three-path strategy (parallel effort):
    - **Path A (Low Cost, High Risk):** Intensive COTS search (obscure suppliers, overseas, custom inquiries)
      - Budget: $5K inquiry costs, Timeline: 2 weeks, Probability: 20%
    - **Path B (High Cost, Low Risk):** Custom actuator 2-week quickturn (piezo OR solenoid)
      - Budget: $25K-50K NRE, Timeline: 2-4 weeks, Probability: 90%
    - **Path C (Spec Compromise):** Relax 2.5mm pitch ‚Üí 3.5mm (violates ADA 703.3 but pilot-acceptable)
      - Budget: $0, Timeline: 0 weeks, Probability: 100% (but requirements violated)
  - [ ] Decision point: By end of Week 2, commit to one path
  - [ ] **THIS IS THE MAKE-OR-BREAK DECISION** - Without actuator, ALL architectures fail

- [ ] Define common production process (8-12 weeks, architecture-agnostic base)

  - **ARCH_PIEZO_ECO:** +0 weeks (simplest electrical integration)
  - **ARCH_SOL_ECO:** +2 weeks (mechanical cam tooling)
  - **ARCH_PIEZO_DLX:** +1 week (BLE certification testing)
  - **Custom actuator case:** +8 weeks (design, fab, validation) ‚Üí 16-20 week timeline

  - [ ] Communication interface options (USB-C vs BLE module - architecture-specific)
- [ ] Power supply design considerations (voltage rails, regulation, battery management - architecture-specific)
- [ ] Thermal analysis (worst-case power dissipation, cooling strategy - per architecture)
- [ ] Production timeline detail per architecture (update resources/calculations/timeline-gantt.xlsx)
  - ARCH_PIEZO_ECO: 8-10 weeks (COTS piezo if available)
  - ARCH_SOL_ECO: 10-12 weeks (mechanical tooling for cam)
  - ARCH_PIEZO_DLX: 10-12 weeks (BLE certification)
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies (detailed breakdown)
  - [ ] **PRIMARY RISK (ALL ARCHITECTURES):** Actuator sourcing
    - Mitigation: Triple-path parallel effort (COTS search + Custom quote + Spec relaxation backup)
    - Contingency: $50K budget allocated for custom actuator NRE
    - Timeline impact: +8 weeks if custom required
  - [ ] **ARCH_PIEZO_ECO risks:** Piezo driver voltage (200V boost converter design)
  - [ ] **ARCH_SOL_ECO risks:** Mechanical cam tooling (CNC programming, tolerance stack-up)
  - [ ] **ARCH_PIEZO_DLX risks:** BLE certification (FCC testing, schedule slip)

- [ ] Create docs/production-process.md with:

## Technical-Debt

### EMI Cost-Down Optimization (Post-Pilot)
- **Purpose:** Reduce EMI component costs from "pass with >6dB margin" to "pass with target margin (3dB)"
- **Rationale:** Current low-risk design uses conservative EMI suppression (1000¬µF bulk caps, 100nF bypass on every IC) to ensure pilot passes preliminary testing on first attempt. Post-pilot, optimize to "just good enough" based on actual measured emissions.
- **Cost reduction opportunities:**
  - **Bulk capacitors:** 1000¬µF ‚Üí 470¬µF or 220¬µF (reduce by 50-75%) ‚Üí Save $1.20-$1.80
  - **Ceramic bypass:** 100nF on all 24 ICs ‚Üí Selectively place only on high-noise drivers ‚Üí Save $0.12-$0.18
  - **Zener clamps:** Currently using ULN2803A internal flyback (free), could add zeners for faster decay if needed (cost neutral)
  - **Ferrite beads:** Currently not in BOM, add only if pre-scan shows >3dB margin violations ‚Üí $0.50 adder if needed
- **Measurement-driven approach:**
  1. Week 7 pilot: EMI pre-scan with spectrum analyzer (baseline measurements)
  2. Identify worst-case emissions (conducted vs radiated, which frequencies)
  3. If >10dB margin: Reduce capacitance by 50% and re-test (cost-down iteration)
  4. If 3-6dB margin: Keep current design (optimal)
  5. If <3dB margin: Add targeted fixes (ferrite beads on specific rails, zener clamps on specific solenoids)
- **Target savings:** $1.50-$2.00 per unit (0.6-0.8% BOM reduction)
- **Risk:** LOW (only optimize after pilot validates baseline design works)
- **Status:** Deferred to Month 3-4 (post-pilot, pre-production volume ramp)
- **Philosophy:** **"Design for standards compliance with margin, then cost-down to target margin"** (not "design minimum and hope it passes")

### Future Slash Command: /arch-tradeoff
- **Purpose:** Generate trade-off analysis documentation from architectures.yaml
- **Rationale:** Separate concerns - /arch-gen focuses on individual architecture details, /arch-tradeoff focuses on comparison/evaluation
- **Reference template:** `docs/_obsolete/architecture-v1.3.0-4arch-manual.md` (22KB strategic analysis with advantages/disadvantages, "When X Wins/Fails", recommendations)
- **Target output:** `docs/tradeoffs.md` (manually edited strategic analysis)
- **Generated artifacts:**
  - `artifacts/architecture-comparison-matrix.md` (quantitative tables - MOVE from /arch-gen)
  - `artifacts/architecture-qualitative-comparison.md` (qualitative ratings across 8 dimensions)
  - `artifacts/architecture-advantages-disadvantages.md` (pros/cons extracted from qualitative YAML data)
  - `artifacts/architecture-decision-trees.md` ("When X Wins/Fails" logic based on quantitative thresholds)
  - `artifacts/architecture-recommendations.md` (portfolio strategy, cost reduction roadmap)
- **Implementation approach:**
  - Read source/architectures.yaml (comparison_dimensions + qualitative/quantitative sections)
  - Generate comparison tables (cost, size, UX, complexity, timeline, mfg, risk, market)
  - Extract advantages from qualitative ratings (üíö BEST/EXCELLENT ‚Üí advantages, üî¥ POOR/FAIR ‚Üí disadvantages)
  - Generate "When X Wins" decision trees from quantitative thresholds (e.g., "if timeline < 7 weeks ‚Üí ARCH-B wins")
  - Generate "When X Fails" from constraints (e.g., "if budget < $300 ‚Üí ARCH-A fails")
  - Keep strategic recommendations in docs/tradeoffs.md (manual)
- **Content mapping from obsolete template:**
  - Section "Advantages" ‚Üí Extract from qualitative üíö ratings
  - Section "Disadvantages" ‚Üí Extract from qualitative üî¥ ratings
  - Section "When X Wins" ‚Üí Generate from quantitative thresholds
  - Section "When X Fails" ‚Üí Generate from constraint violations
  - Section "Trade-Off Analysis Summary" ‚Üí Weighted scoring (manual in docs/tradeoffs.md)
  - Section "Recommendations" ‚Üí Portfolio strategy (manual in docs/tradeoffs.md)
- **Benefit:** /arch-gen stays focused on subsystem details and specs, /arch-tradeoff handles evaluation logic
- **Status:** Deferred to post-interview (not blocking v1.4.0 Trade-off Analysis - can write manually)

### Documentation Structure Clarification
- **docs/_obsolete/architecture-v1.3.0-4arch-manual.md** - OBSOLETE v1.3.0 strategic analysis (moved before renaming + 5th arch)
- **docs/_obsolete/actuator-mechanical-latch-concept-v1.3.0.md** - OBSOLETE latch concept (specific to old ARCH-D design)
- **artifacts/architecture.md** - Technical reference with subsystem details (auto-generated via /arch-gen)
- **artifacts/architecture-comparison-matrix.md** - Quantitative comparison tables (auto-generated, currently by /arch-gen)
- **docs/tradeoffs.md** - Strategic trade-off analysis (v1.4.0, manually written)
- **docs/solution.md** - Recommended solution with justification (v1.5.0, manually written)
- Future: /arch-tradeoff command will auto-generate advantages/disadvantages, decision trees from YAML

### Enhanced Requirements Traceability Analysis
- **Purpose:** Create comprehensive coverage matrix showing which requirements each architecture satisfies
- **Plan:** See [docs/requirements-trace-plan.md](docs/requirements-trace-plan.md) for complete implementation details
- **Priority:** P1-High (affects traceability rubric score)
- **Effort:** 2-3 hours (Python script enhancement)
- **Status:** Deferred to post-interview
