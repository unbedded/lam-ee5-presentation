## Post-Interview Updates

### <span style="color:green">v3.3.0: Power Calculation Corrections ✅</span>
**Date:** Oct 22, 2025 (day before interview)

**Critical Fix: PIEZO vs SOLENOID Power Metrics**
- [x] Fixed PIEZO power calculations (dots ASSERTED):
  - Per dot: 2.25 mW (250µJ × 45Hz × 20% recharge)
  - Realistic (50% dots asserted): 0.22W (was incorrectly 0.43W)
  - Worst case (100% dots asserted): 0.43W
- [x] Fixed SOLENOID power calculations (dots CHANGED):
  - Per dot: 6.6 mW avg (120mJ / 18s between changes)
  - Realistic (33% dots change): 1.27W (was incorrectly 0.38W)
  - Worst case (100% dots change): 3.84W
- [x] Added "TOTAL POWER Per dot (avg)" row for clarity
- [x] Updated all speaker notes with step-by-step math derivations
- [x] Result: PIEZO wins 5.8× on power (0.22W vs 1.27W)

**Commit:** 65d8f8b "fix(presentation): Correct power calculations"

### <span style="color:green">v4.0.0: Documentation & Retrospective ✅</span>
**Date:** Oct 23, 2025 (post-interview)

**README.md Updates:**
- [x] Added "Post-Interview Lessons Learned" section
  - What worked (technical depth, requirements rigor, AI transparency)
  - What to improve (timeline messaging, "pick a winner", forgot backup slides)
  - Discoveries (COTS piezo exists, timeline reality check)
  - AI philosophy: "Not-Trust, Always Verify"
- [x] Added "AI-Assisted Slide Workflow (Retrospective)" section
  - 5-phase workflow documented (Requirements → Architecture → Slides → Verification → Refinement)
  - Time breakdown: 22h human + 17.5h AI = 39.5h total
  - Key principles, what AI did well vs struggled with
  - "Not-Trust, Always Verify" workflow diagram
- [x] Project status: ✅ Interview Complete
- [x] Outcome: 80% chance of offer, no other candidates

**Commit:** 620f880 "docs(README): Add post-interview lessons learned and AI workflow retrospective"

## Technical Debt (Future Improvements)

### For Future Interviews/Projects

**Main Deck Additions (based on feedback):**
1. Add "RECOMMENDATION: Pick a Winner" slide (after trade-off analysis)
2. Move "Realistic Timeline: 12-Week Plan" from backup to main deck
3. Move "Resource Plan: FTE & NRE" from backup to main deck

**Backup Additions:**
4. Add "AI-Assisted Workflow" visual (transparency diagram)

**Speaker Notes:**
- Add "See backup slide X" reminders for common Q&A topics
- Internalize ALL backup content (don't let AI-generated slides become black boxes)

**Role Framing:**
- Present as "EE Lead + PM" (not just "Electrical Engineer")
- Own end-to-end: design + team + schedule + budget + risk
- Program Director = VP-level strategy, not day-to-day PM

### Slash Command: /arch-tradeoff (Deferred)
- **Purpose:** Generate trade-off analysis documentation from architectures.yaml
- **Status:** Deferred to future projects (wrote manually this time)

### Enhanced Requirements Traceability (Deferred)
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive coverage matrix (requirements → architectures)
- **Status:** Deferred to post-interview

### EMI Cost-Down Optimization (Post-Pilot)
- **Purpose:** Reduce EMI component costs from "pass with >6dB margin" to target
- **Status:** Deferred to Month 3-4 (post-pilot, pre-production)

**Lines of Code (Automation):**
- Python scripts: 500+ lines
- YAML databases: 1,100+ lines
- Slash commands: 8 custom commands

**Documentation Generated:**
- Requirements: 17 (470 lines YAML → 32KB Markdown)
- Architectures: 3 (280 lines YAML → auto-generated BOMs)
- Presentation: 40+ slides (Markdown → HTML + PDF)
- Analysis docs: 6 (market scan, actuator tech, EMI, power, COTS, latch)

**Final Deliverables Size:**
- Artifacts zip: 5.7 MB
- Presentation PDF: 9% compressed (from HTML)
- Total documentation: ~150 pages

**Project Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Outcome:** 80% chance of offer, no other candidates
**Date Completed:** October 23, 2025
**Next Steps:** Wait for offer decision from LAM Research

**Experiment Conclusion:** AI-assisted workflow (Claude Code) accelerated technical work by 1.5-2× while maintaining rigorous verification standards. "Not-Trust, Always Verify" discipline caught critical errors (power calculations, assumption rates) that would have undermined credibility. Portfolio approach (3 architectures) and honest engineering (realistic timelines, documented assumptions) were well-received by hiring panel.
