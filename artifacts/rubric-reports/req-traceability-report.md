**Status:** ‚è≥ **NO DESIGN DOCUMENTS YET** (v1.2.0 phase)

Design documents will be created in v1.3.0+:
- `docs/architecture.md` - Solution architectures (v1.3.0)
- `docs/tradeoffs.md` - Trade-off analysis (v1.4.0)
- `docs/solution.md` - Recommended solution (v1.5.0)

**Orphaned Design Elements:** None (no design yet)

- Hierarchical tree shows parent-child relationships (PRD-XXXX-NNN ‚Üí PRD-XXXX-NNN-ASMP) ‚úÖ
- Standards compliance section references NFR-STD-001 and NFR-STD-002 ‚úÖ

**Document References Found:**

| Req ID | Referenced In | Context |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| PRD-SCHED-001 | requirements.md:157 | Ground truth requirement |
| PRD-SCHED-001-ASMP | requirements.md:315 | Assumption (pilot production) |
| PRD-SIZE-001 | requirements.md:162 | Ground truth requirement |

| NFR-STD-002 | requirements.md:600 | ADA accessibility |

**Assessment:** All requirements properly traced to analysis document ‚úÖ

---

### Presentation Planning Documents

**docs/presentation-key-messages.md:**
- References PRD-COST-001-ASMP ($200 ¬±$100 BOM, not "$200")
- References portfolio approach (PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP: BLE vs USB-C)
- Supports systems engineering philosophy (ranges vs absolutes)

**docs/requirements-philosophy-alignment.md:**
- Shows how hierarchical PRD naming supports presentation thesis
- Links pdf_verbatim ‚Üí our_assumption ‚Üí sensitivity_range workflow
- Demonstrates customer_validation_needed tracking

**Assessment:** Requirements philosophy well-documented and aligned with presentation strategy ‚úÖ

---

### Reverse Trace Validation

**Check if all `traces_to` links are valid:**

**Current State (v1.2.0):**
- All requirements have `traces_to` structure defined in YAML ‚úÖ
- All `traces_to` fields are currently empty (expected at v1.2.0) ‚úÖ
- No broken links (nothing to break yet) ‚úÖ

**Example from requirements.yaml:**
```yaml
# Traceability structure exists but not yet populated (correct for v1.2.0)
# Will be populated in v1.3.0+ as design/tradeoffs/solution documents are created
```

**Broken Links Found:** 0 ‚úÖ

---

## Gap Analysis

### 1. High-Priority Orphaned Requirements

**Critical (P0) with no traces:** 0 ‚úÖ

All P0 requirements have analysis traces. Design/tradeoffs/solution traces will be added in v1.3.0+.

**High (P1) with no traces:** 0 ‚úÖ

All P1 requirements have analysis traces. Design/tradeoffs/solution traces will be added in v1.3.0+.

**Assessment:** No orphaned requirements. All 17 requirements documented in artifacts/requirements.md.

---

### 2. Orphaned Design Decisions

**Design elements without requirement justification:** None

**Reason:** No design documents exist yet (v1.2.0 is requirements phase).

**Action for v1.3.0:** When creating docs/architecture.md, ensure every design decision references a requirement ID (PRD-XXXX-NNN or NFR-STD-NNN).

---

### 3. Broken Traceability Links

**Invalid `traces_to` references:** 0 ‚úÖ

**Reason:** Traceability structure exists in YAML but fields are empty (correct for v1.2.0).

**Action for v1.3.0+:** Populate `traces_to.design`, `traces_to.tradeoffs`, `traces_to.solution` as documents are created.

---

### 4. Phase-Appropriate Trace Expectations

**Current Phase:** v1.2.0 (Requirements Analysis)

**Expected traces at this phase:**
- ‚úÖ v1.2.0: All requirements should have `analysis` trace ‚Üí **MET (17/17)**
- ‚è≥ v1.3.0: P0/P1 requirements should have `design` trace ‚Üí **PENDING**
- ‚è≥ v1.4.0: P0/P1 requirements should have `tradeoffs` trace ‚Üí **PENDING**
- ‚è≥ v1.5.0: P0/P1 requirements should have `solution` trace ‚Üí **PENDING**

**Missing expected traces:** None (v1.2.0 expectations fully met)

**Future Trace Expectations (v1.3.0+):**

| Phase | Expected Traces | Requirements | Status |
|-------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| v1.3.0 | Design (architecture.md) | All 17 (focus P0/P1) | ‚è≥ TODO |
| v1.4.0 | Tradeoffs (tradeoffs.md) | P0/P1 (17 total) | ‚è≥ TODO |
| v1.5.0 | Solution (solution.md) | P0/P1 (17 total) | ‚è≥ TODO |
| v1.6.0+ | Tests (test cases) | P0 (8 critical) | ‚è≥ TODO |

---

## Compliance Summary

| Metric | Current | Target (v1.2.0) | Status |
|--------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Analysis Traced | 100% (17/17) | 100% | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |
| P0 Analysis Traced | 100% (8/8) | 100% | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |
| P1 Analysis Traced | 100% (9/9) | 100% | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |
| Orphaned Requirements | 0% (0/17) | 0% | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |
| Broken Links | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |

| Metric | Current | Target (v1.5.0) | Status |
|--------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| P0 Fully Traced | 0% (0/8) | 100% | ‚è≥ PENDING (v1.3.0+) |
| P1 Fully Traced | 0% (9/9) | 80% | ‚è≥ PENDING (v1.3.0+) |

**Overall Traceability Health:** ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT** (for v1.2.0 phase)

---

## Recommendations

### For v1.2.0 Completion (Current Phase)

‚úÖ **No actions required** - Traceability is complete and appropriate for requirements phase.

---

### For v1.3.0 (Architecture Design - Next Phase)

**Critical Actions:**

1. **Create docs/architecture.md** with multiple solution architectures
2. **Reference requirements explicitly** in architecture document:
   - Use format: "This architecture satisfies PRD-FUNC-001 (192 actuators)..."
   - Include requirement IDs in architecture comparison tables
   - Justify design decisions with requirement references

3. **Update requirements.yaml** with `traces_to.design` links:
   ```yaml
   PRD-FUNC-001:
     traces_to:
       analysis: "artifacts/requirements.md#prd-func-001"
       design: "docs/architecture.md#actuator-selection"
   ```

4. **Re-run /req-trace** after v1.3.0 complete to validate design traceability

---

### For v1.4.0 (Trade-off Analysis)

1. **Create docs/tradeoffs.md** with quantitative comparison
2. **Reference requirements in trade-off matrices**:
   - Cost analysis ‚Üí PRD-COST-001-ASMP ($100-$300 BOM sensitivity)
   - Timeline analysis ‚Üí PRD-SCHED-001-ASMP (2-month pilot constraint)
   - Interface comparison ‚Üí PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP (BLE vs USB-C)

3. **Update requirements.yaml** with `traces_to.tradeoffs` links

---

### For v1.5.0 (Recommended Solution)

1. **Create docs/solution.md** with final architecture selection
2. **Justify selection with requirement satisfaction**:
   - Show which requirements drove the decision
   - Reference trade-off analysis (v1.4.0)
   - Include production timeline (PRD-SCHED-001-ASMP)

3. **Update requirements.yaml** with `traces_to.solution` links

---

## Traceability Maintenance

**Best Practices for v1.3.0+:**

1. **When adding a requirement:**
   - Add to source/requirements.yaml first (SSOT)
   - Run `/req-yaml-to-md` to regenerate artifacts/requirements.md
   - Immediately add to relevant design docs (architecture.md, tradeoffs.md, solution.md)
   - Update `traces_to` fields in YAML

2. **When making design decisions:**
   - Reference justifying requirement ID in design document
   - Example: "Selected piezo actuators (satisfies PRD-FUNC-001: ‚â§2.3mm diameter constraint)"
   - Include requirement IDs in tables, figures, and section headers where applicable

3. **After each phase completion:**
   - Run `/req-trace` to validate traceability
   - Fix any broken links or orphaned requirements/design
   - Update TODO.md to mark traceability tasks complete

4. **Automated checks:**
   - `/req-audit` validates requirement structure ‚úÖ (completed v1.2.0)
   - `/req-trace` validates traceability ‚úÖ (this report)
   - `/rubric-eval` includes traceability assessment (v1.6.0)

---

## Key Design Drivers (High Traceability Impact)

These requirements will drive the most design decisions in v1.3.0 (reference them frequently):

**Mechanical/Actuator Design:**
- PRD-FUNC-001: 192 actuators (32 cells √ó 6 dots), ‚â§2.3mm diameter constraint
- PRD-FUNC-003: Binary actuation, 0.5-0.7mm raised, >1M cycles
- NFR-STD-002: ADA compliance (2.5mm pitch, 1.5mm dot diameter)

**Interface Architecture:**
- PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP: BLE vs USB-C vs hybrid portfolio
- NFR-STD-001: FCC Part 15C (if BLE), UL 2054 (if battery)

**Cost/Manufacturing:**
- PRD-COST-001-ASMP: $200 ¬±$100 BOM ($100-$300 sensitivity range)
- PRD-VOL-001-ASMP: 10k/month SMT capability

**Timeline:**
- PRD-SCHED-001-ASMP: 2-month pilot (100-500 units), not mass production

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **v1.2.0 Complete** - Requirements analysis fully traced
2. ‚û°Ô∏è **v1.3.0 Start** - Create architecture.md with requirement references
3. üîÑ **Update traces_to** - Populate `design` fields in requirements.yaml as architecture evolves
4. üìä **Re-run /req-trace** - Validate design traceability after v1.3.0 complete
5. üéØ **v1.4.0/v1.5.0** - Continue traceability through trade-offs and solution

---

**TRACEABILITY REPORT COMPLETE**

**Confidence Level:** High - Ready to proceed to v1.3.0 (Architecture Design)
