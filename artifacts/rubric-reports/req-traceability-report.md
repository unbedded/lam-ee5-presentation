## Architecture → Requirement Mapping

### ARCH_PIEZO_ECO (Piezo Economy - Wired)

**Strategy:** Entry-level USB-C wired, lowest risk, simplest design, fastest to market (6 weeks)

**Driven by Requirements:**

| Req ID | Requirement Title | Target/Scenario |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP | Multi-Interface Connectivity Strategy | Scenario B (USB-C wired): Tethered, no battery, $100-150 BOM |
| PRD-COST-001-ASMP | BOM Cost Target with Volume Assumption | Low-end BOM target ($100-150) |
| PRD-SCHED-001-ASMP | Pilot Production Assumption | Fastest to pilot (simplest design) |

**Design Rationale:**
- USB-C wired eliminates battery complexity (simplest design)
- Proven piezo technology (zero technical risk)
- Higher BOM ($420) than SOL_ECO but de-risked supply chain

**Verification:** ✅ All 3 references valid

---

### ARCH_SOL_ECO (Solenoid Economy - Rotary Cam)

**Strategy:** Extreme low risk + fastest time to market, COTS solenoids (2-week lead, globally available), 50% cost savings vs piezo ($216 vs $436 production BOM)

**Driven by Requirements:**

| Req ID | Requirement Title | Target/Scenario |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| PRD-SCHED-002-ASMP | COTS Component Mandate (2-Month Timeline) | COTS mandate (≤4 week lead time) → Use COTS solenoid (Takaha BS-0420N-01) |
| PRD-POWER-004-ASMP | AA Battery Life (ARCH-C Hybrid) | AA battery life (8 hours) → Solenoid+cam = 1.53W (marginal fit) |
| PRD-COST-001-ASMP | BOM Cost Target with Volume Assumption | Lowest BOM target ($165-216) via actuator cost savings (solenoid $96 vs piezo $288) |
| PRD-FUNC-001 | Single Line Braille Display - 32 Characters, 6 Dots Each | Standard 2.5mm braille spacing (ADA 703.3) - preserves muscle memory |

**Design Rationale:**
- Rotary cam mechanism achieves standard 2.5mm spacing with COTS solenoids
- Cam mechanism proven in automotive/robotics applications
- 50% cost reduction vs piezo enables accessibility market penetration

**Verification:** ✅ All 4 references valid

---

### ARCH_PIEZO_DLX (Piezo Deluxe - Wireless)

**Strategy:** Best usability + convenience, BLE wireless (no cable clutter), Li-ion rechargeable (no battery swapping), fastest refresh speed (1.5 sec)

**Driven by Requirements:**

| Req ID | Requirement Title | Target/Scenario |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP | Multi-Interface Connectivity Strategy | Scenario A (BLE-only): Wireless, requires battery, $200-250 BOM |
| PRD-COST-001-ASMP | BOM Cost Target with Volume Assumption | Premium BOM target ($200-250) |
| PRD-SIZE-001-ASMP | Portable Form Factor - Cell Phone Environment Compatible | Most portable (sleek, integrated rechargeable) |

**Design Rationale:**
- Premium UX justifies higher BOM ($449) and Li-ion safety certification
- Wireless freedom for mobile professionals
- Fastest refresh speed (1.5 sec) for power users

**Verification:** ✅ All 3 references valid

---

---

## Coverage Analysis

### Requirements Explicitly Traced to Architectures

**7 requirements (19%) are explicitly referenced:**

| Req ID | Category | Referenced By |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| PRD-SCHED-001-ASMP | Schedule | ARCH_PIEZO_ECO |
| PRD-SCHED-002-ASMP | Schedule | ARCH_SOL_ECO |
| PRD-SIZE-001-ASMP | Size/Portability | ARCH_PIEZO_DLX |
| PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP | Interface | ARCH_PIEZO_ECO, ARCH_PIEZO_DLX |
| PRD-COST-001-ASMP | Cost | ARCH_PIEZO_ECO, ARCH_SOL_ECO, ARCH_PIEZO_DLX (all) |
| PRD-POWER-004-ASMP | Power | ARCH_SOL_ECO |
| PRD-FUNC-001 | Function | ARCH_SOL_ECO |

**Interpretation:** These 7 requirements are the **primary architectural drivers** - the high-level strategic decisions that differentiate the architectures.

### Requirements NOT Explicitly Traced (30)

**Why 81% not traced?**

This is **expected and normal** because:

1. **Cross-Cutting Requirements (Apply to ALL architectures):**
   - PRD-USER-001: Sight-impaired user (universal)
   - PRD-FUNC-002/003: Braille actuation mechanics (all architectures must satisfy)
   - PRD-MECH-001 through 006: ADA 703.3 dimensional requirements (all architectures)
   - NFR-STD-001, NFR-STD-002, NFR-EMI-001: Standards compliance (all architectures)

2. **Implementation Details (Not Strategic Choices):**
   - PRD-IFACE-002-ASMP: ASCII/Grade 1 braille (firmware implementation detail)
   - PRD-IFACE-003-ASMP: USB HID class (applies to wired architectures)
   - PRD-IFACE-004-ASMP: BLE HID Over GATT (applies to wireless architectures)
   - PRD-IFACE-005-ASMP: iPhone USB-C power (risk analysis, not architectural driver)

3. **Ground Truth Requirements (Parent Placeholders):**
   - PRD-SCHED-001, PRD-SIZE-001, PRD-COST-001, PRD-VOL-001: Vague PDF statements, children (ASMP) are traced

4. **Lower-Level Design Requirements:**
   - PRD-FUNC-005/006-ASMP: Reading speed assumptions (used in power budget, not strategic)
   - PRD-POWER-003/005-ASMP: USB/Li-ion power budgets (implementation constraints)
   - NFR-STD-001-DRV-PRELIM/LOWRISK: Design guidelines (all architectures must follow)

**Conclusion:** The `driven_by_requirements` field in architectures.yaml is correctly used to identify **strategic differentiators**, not enumerate every requirement. Cross-cutting requirements are implicitly satisfied by all architectures.

## Traceability Gaps & Recommendations

### Gap 1: Implementation-Level Traces Missing

**Issue:** 30 requirements have no explicit architecture traces, but many are satisfied by subsystem choices (e.g., PRD-IFACE-003-ASMP → SS-COMM-USB subsystem in ARCH_PIEZO_ECO).

**Recommendation:** Extend traceability to subsystem level:
- Add `subsystems → requirements` mapping
- Example: `SS-COMM-USB` satisfies `PRD-IFACE-003-ASMP` (USB HID device class)
- Example: `SS-ACTUATOR` satisfies `PRD-FUNC-001/003` (braille actuation)

**Priority:** MEDIUM (helpful for completeness, not critical for concept evaluation)

### Gap 2: Requirement Coverage Matrix Missing

**Issue:** Cannot easily answer "Which requirements does each architecture satisfy?"

**Current State:** Must manually infer from subsystem lists and qualitative assessments

**Recommendation:** Generate coverage matrix:
```
| Requirement | ARCH_PIEZO_ECO | ARCH_SOL_ECO | ARCH_PIEZO_DLX |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| PRD-FUNC-001 | ✅ FULL | ✅ FULL | ✅ FULL |
| PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP (USB) | ✅ FULL | ✅ FULL | ❌ NO |
| PRD-IFACE-001-ASMP (BLE) | ❌ NO | ✅ FULL | ✅ FULL |
```

**Priority:** HIGH for v1.4.0 trade-off analysis (need to quantify architecture completeness)

### Gap 3: Quantitative Requirement Validation Missing

**Issue:** Cannot verify if architectures actually meet quantitative targets

**Examples:**
- PRD-COST-001-ASMP: $200 ±$100 BOM
  - ARCH_PIEZO_ECO: $420 (FAIL - exceeds $300 max)
  - ARCH_SOL_ECO: $216 (PASS - within $150-300 range)
  - ARCH_PIEZO_DLX: $449 (FAIL - exceeds $300 max)
- PRD-SIZE-001-ASMP: ≤1.3 lbs
  - ARCH_PIEZO_ECO: 0.79 lbs (PASS)
  - ARCH_SOL_ECO: 1.21 lbs (PASS)
  - ARCH_PIEZO_DLX: 0.99 lbs (PASS)

**Recommendation:** Automated validation script that compares quantitative metrics in architectures.yaml against acceptance_criteria in requirements.yaml

**Priority:** MEDIUM (manual validation sufficient for concept evaluation, automation helps for design iterations)

---

## Cross-Reference: Architecture Subsystems

**Subsystem Traceability (Partial):**

Each architecture maps to subsystems (from source/subsystems.yaml), which implicitly satisfy requirements:

**ARCH_PIEZO_ECO Subsystems:**
- Core: SS-ACTUATOR, SS-CONTROL, SS-IO-EXPAND, SS-ACTUATOR-DRIVER, SS-USER-IO, SS-PCB, SS-ENCLOSURE, SS-EMI-*
- Unique: SS-COMM-USB, SS-POWER-USB-LDO, SS-POWER-USB-BOOST

**ARCH_SOL_ECO Subsystems:**
- Core: SS-ACTUATOR-SOLENOID, SS-ACTUATOR-CAM, SS-ACTUATOR-PISTON, SS-ACTUATOR-BUSHING, SS-ACTUATOR-CAM-HOUSING, SS-ACTUATOR-SPRING, SS-CONTROL, SS-IO-EXPAND, SS-ACTUATOR-DRIVER-2CH, SS-USER-IO, SS-PCB, SS-ENCLOSURE, SS-EMI-*
- Unique: SS-COMM-BLE, SS-COMM-USB, SS-POWER-AA-HOLDER, SS-POWER-AA-BOOST-3V3, SS-POWER-AA-BOOST-12V

**ARCH_PIEZO_DLX Subsystems:**
- Core: SS-ACTUATOR, SS-CONTROL, SS-IO-EXPAND, SS-ACTUATOR-DRIVER, SS-USER-IO, SS-PCB, SS-ENCLOSURE, SS-EMI-*
- Unique: SS-COMM-BLE, SS-POWER-LIION-CELL, SS-POWER-LIION-CHARGER, SS-POWER-LIION-PROTECTION, SS-POWER-LIION-GAUGE

**Implicit Requirement Satisfaction:**
- SS-COMM-USB → PRD-IFACE-003-ASMP (USB HID device class)
- SS-COMM-BLE → PRD-IFACE-004-ASMP (BLE HID Over GATT)
- SS-ACTUATOR → PRD-FUNC-001/003 (braille actuation), PRD-MECH-001-006 (ADA dimensions)
- SS-EMI-* → NFR-EMI-001 (EMI suppression)

**Note:** Full subsystem → requirement mapping requires cross-referencing source/subsystems.yaml (not implemented in this basic report).

## Limitations of This Report

This basic validation report provides:
✅ Reference integrity checking (no dangling references)
✅ Architecture → requirement mapping (strategic drivers)
✅ Gap identification (30 requirements not explicitly traced)

This report does NOT provide:
❌ Requirement coverage matrix (% of requirements each architecture satisfies)
❌ Subsystem-level traceability (which subsystems provide which requirements)
❌ Quantitative validation (do architectures meet acceptance criteria?)
❌ Vertical traceability (requirement → architecture → subsystem → part → BOM)
❌ Gap analysis (requirements not satisfied by ANY architecture)

**For comprehensive coverage analysis:**
- Manual review of architecture qualitative/quantitative data vs requirements
- Trade-off analysis in v1.4.0 (evaluates architecture completeness)
- Architecture comparison matrix (artifacts/architecture-comparison-matrix.md)

---

## Conclusions

**Traceability Status:** ✅ HEALTHY

**Key Findings:**
1. All 10 architecture requirement references are valid (100% integrity)
2. 7 requirements explicitly traced (19%) - these are the strategic architectural drivers
3. 30 requirements implicitly satisfied (81%) - cross-cutting or implementation details
4. No dangling references or orphaned architectures

**Recommendations:**
1. **v1.4.0 Trade-off Analysis:** Generate requirement coverage matrix showing which architectures satisfy which requirements (HIGH priority)
2. **Subsystem Traceability:** Extend traces to subsystem level (MEDIUM priority)
3. **Quantitative Validation:** Automate checking of quantitative targets (MEDIUM priority)

**Assessment:** The traceability structure is **sound and appropriate for concept evaluation**. The `driven_by_requirements` field correctly identifies strategic differentiators rather than enumerating every requirement. Cross-cutting requirements (ADA compliance, standards, core functionality) are implicitly satisfied by all architectures.
