## Executive Summary

**Overall Compliance: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS** (pending removal of 1 architecture-specific requirement)

- **Naming Compliance:** 39/39 (100%) ✅
- **Mandatory Fields:** 39/39 (100%) ✅
- **Category Consistency:** 39/39 (100%) ✅
- **SMART Criteria:** 36/39 (92%) ⚠️
- **Traceability:** Pending v1.3.0 architecture (expected at this stage)
- **Priority Distribution:** Balanced (66% P0, 28% P1, 5% P2) ✅

**Critical Issues:** 1 (PRD-FUNC-003-ARCH-C-EXCEPT is architecture-specific, should be in design docs)  
**Warnings:** 2 (interface requirements restructure complete, excellent quality)  
**Recommendations:** 3 (remove ARCH-C-EXCEPT, enhance verification methods, create traceability matrix)

**Key Achievements in v2.2.0:**
- ✅ Interface requirements split: PRD-IFACE-001 (connection) + PRD-IFACE-002 (data format)
- ✅ Added CRITICAL USB HID requirement (PRD-IFACE-003-ASMP) for iOS/Android compatibility
- ✅ Added CRITICAL iPhone USB-C power risk (PRD-IFACE-005-ASMP) - Week 5-6 validation needed
- ✅ Added BLE HID Over GATT requirement (PRD-IFACE-004-ASMP)
- ✅ 6 mechanical requirements from ADA 703.3 properly derived
- ⚠️ PRD-FUNC-003-ARCH-C-EXCEPT needs to move to architecture docs

---

## 1. Naming Convention Compliance

**Status:** ✅ PASS

All 39 requirements follow consistent hierarchical PRD naming:
- **Ground Truth:** `PRD-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (10 requirements from PDF)
- **Assumptions:** `PRD-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]-ASMP` (20 derived specifications)
- **Standards/Compliance:** `NFR-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (3 requirements)
- **Mechanical:** `PRD-MECH-[NUMBER]` (6 requirements from ADA 703.3)

**Issues Found:** None ✅

**Exception to Flag:** PRD-FUNC-003-ARCH-C-EXCEPT violates naming principle (architecture-specific suffix "-ARCH-C-EXCEPT" indicates design decision, not requirement)

---

## 2. Mandatory Fields Compliance

**Status:** ✅ PASS

All requirements have:
- `title` ✅ (39/39 - 100%)
- `priority` ✅ (39/39 - 100%)
- `category` ✅ (39/39 - 100%)
- `source` or `pdf_verbatim` or `parent` ✅ (39/39 - 100%)

**Category consistency:** 100% - all categories match ID prefixes semantically.

---

## 3. SMART Criteria Analysis

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS (92% compliance - 36/39 fully SMART)

### Issues Identified:

| Req ID | Score | Issues |
|--------|-------|--------|
| PRD-SIZE-001 | 4/5 | Intentionally VAGUE (PDF fault), fixed by PRD-SIZE-001-ASMP ✅ |
| PRD-FUNC-002 | 4/5 | Intentionally VAGUE (PDF fault), fixed by PRD-FUNC-002-ASMP ✅ |
| **PRD-FUNC-003-ARCH-C-EXCEPT** | **3/5** | **ARCHITECTURE-SPECIFIC (not a requirement)** ❌ |

**Note:** Ground truth requirements PRD-SIZE-001 and PRD-FUNC-002 are intentionally VAGUE (verbatim from PDF). Their child assumptions are fully SMART. This is correct engineering practice.

**Critical Finding:** PRD-FUNC-003-ARCH-C-EXCEPT describes a design trade-off for ARCH_SOL_ECO (4mm solenoid exception), NOT a universal requirement.

---

## 4. Priority Distribution

| Priority | Count | Percentage | Assessment |
|----------|-------|------------|------------|
| P0-Critical | 26 | 66% | ⚠️ High but justified for 2-month timeline |
| P1-High | 11 | 28% | ✅ Good |
| P2-Medium | 2 | 5% | ⚠️ Low (aggressive scope) |
| P3-Low | 0 | 0% | ⚠️ None (all features critical or deferred) |

**Assessment:** ✅ Distribution is aggressive (66% P0) but **justified** for interview scenario:
- 2-month timeline to pilot production = no flexibility
- Interface requirements (USB HID, BLE HID, iPhone power) are **fundamental** to device working
- Mechanical requirements (ADA 703.3) are **non-negotiable** for usability
- Standards compliance (FCC, UL, ADA) are **mandatory** for market entry

---

## 5. Interface Requirements Quality (v2.2.0 Additions)

**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT

### New Requirements in v2.2.0:

**PRD-IFACE-003-ASMP: USB-C HID Device Class**
- ✅ **CRITICAL** requirement for driverless iOS/Android operation
- ✅ Correctly identifies iOS VoiceOver requirement (HID class mandatory, no custom drivers allowed)
- ✅ Specifies USB HID v1.11 Braille Display Usage Page (0x41)
- ✅ Clear acceptance criteria (device class 0x03, enumeration <2s, auto-detect)
- **Impact:** Without this, USB-C wired architecture would fail on iPhone/Android

**PRD-IFACE-004-ASMP: BLE HID Over GATT Protocol**
- ✅ Correctly identifies BLE HID Over GATT as standard profile (not SPP)
- ✅ Avoids custom app development ($20K-30K, 2-3 months, App Store approval risk)
- ✅ Native iOS 7+ and Android 4.4+ support
- **Impact:** Enables wireless operation without custom firmware or apps

**PRD-IFACE-005-ASMP: iPhone USB-C Power Budget Assumption**
- ✅ **CRITICAL RISK** properly flagged
- ✅ Identifies unknown: Does iPhone 15+ provide full 500mA @ 5V for accessories?
- ✅ Test plan: Week 5-6 hardware validation with iPhone 15/16 + USB power analyzer
- ✅ Mitigation strategies if assumption fails (reduce power, add battery, BLE-only for iOS)
- **Impact:** If wrong, USB-C architecture fails on iPhone (50% of mobile market)

**Assessment:** These 3 new interface requirements demonstrate **excellent engineering judgment**:
- Fundamental requirements were missing in v2.1.0 (device couldn't work without HID class)
- Critical risk identified early (iPhone power availability = UNKNOWN, needs validation)
- Clear test plans and mitigation strategies

---

## 6. Standards Compliance

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Standards Requirements:** 8 (NFR-STD-001, NFR-STD-002, NFR-EMI-001, + 5 derived)

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Safety: UL 62368-1 (Electrical), UL 2054 (Battery)
- ✅ EMI/RF: FCC Part 15 Class B, FCC Part 15C (BLE)
- ✅ Accessibility: US ADA Section 703.3 (6 mechanical requirements derived)
- ✅ Low-risk design approach (4-layer PCB, pre-certified modules, >6dB margin)

---

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before v1.3.0)

### 1. **PRD-FUNC-003-ARCH-C-EXCEPT is Architecture-Specific, Not a Requirement**
   - **Requirement ID:** PRD-FUNC-003-ARCH-C-EXCEPT
   - **Problem:** This "requirement" describes a **design decision** for ARCH_SOL_ECO (solenoid architecture):
     - Allows 4mm actuator diameter (vs 2.3mm standard)
     - Relaxes cell pitch to 3.5mm (vs 2.5mm standard)
     - Increases device length to 280mm (vs 198mm standard)
   - **Why This is Wrong:**
     - Requirements should be **architecture-agnostic** (apply to all solutions)
     - This "requirement" only applies to one specific architecture (ARCH_SOL_ECO)
     - It describes a **trade-off** (timeline compliance vs device size), which belongs in v1.3.0 architecture docs
     - Creates confusion: "Do we have two different requirements for dot spacing?" (2.5mm vs 3.5mm)
   - **Impact:**
     - Violates separation of concerns (requirements vs design)
     - Makes requirements.yaml architecture-dependent
     - Could mislead stakeholders about what the "requirement" actually is
   - **Fix:**
     - **REMOVE** PRD-FUNC-003-ARCH-C-EXCEPT from requirements.yaml
     - **MOVE** content to architecture document as design rationale:
       - `docs/arch-sol-eco-mechanical-design.md` or `docs/arch-sol-eco-tradeoffs.md`
       - Document as: "ARCH_SOL_ECO Design Trade-off: We relax dot pitch to 3.5mm (from 2.5mm ADA standard) to accommodate 4mm COTS solenoid, trading device length (280mm vs 198mm) for timeline compliance (2-week lead time vs 8-12 week custom piezo). This is within ADA 703.3 spec (2.3-3.8mm cell spacing allowed)."
     - Keep PRD-FUNC-003 as the **universal requirement** (≤2.3mm actuator for 2.5mm pitch)
     - Let ARCH_SOL_ECO **partially satisfy** PRD-FUNC-003 with documented trade-off in architecture docs

**After fix:** 38 requirements total (not 39)

---

## Warnings (Should Address Soon)

### 1. **Update Requirements Count After Removing ARCH-C-EXCEPT**
   - Metadata shows v2.2.0 with 39 requirements
   - After removing PRD-FUNC-003-ARCH-C-EXCEPT → 38 requirements
   - Update metadata version to v2.3.0 (architectural requirement cleanup)

### 2. **Forward Traceability Not Yet Established**
   - Expected at v1.2.0 phase (requirements complete, architecture TBD)
   - Add `traces_to` fields after v1.3.0 architecture designs

---

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. **Remove PRD-FUNC-003-ARCH-C-EXCEPT (Critical)**
   - Move to `docs/arch-sol-eco-mechanical-design.md` as design rationale
   - Update requirements.yaml metadata: v2.2.0 → v2.3.0, 39 → 38 requirements
   - Regenerate requirements.md

### 2. **Add Verification Methods to All Requirements**
   - Most requirements have `acceptance_criteria`, some lack explicit `verification_method`
   - Add one of: Analysis, Inspection, Test, Demonstration

### 3. **Create Requirements-Architecture Traceability Matrix (v1.3.0)**
   - After architecture designs complete, generate matrix showing:
     - Which requirements each architecture satisfies (full/partial/not satisfied)
     - Trade-offs made (e.g., ARCH_SOL_ECO trades size for timeline)
     - Gap analysis (requirements not met by any architecture)
