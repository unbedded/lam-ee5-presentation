## Your Task

Evaluate this EE concept evaluation project against the comprehensive rubric defined in `docs/interview-rubric.md`.

---

## Evaluation Scope

### Determine Evaluation Phase

**Check current deliverables:**
- v1.1.0 complete? → Evaluate `docs/quality-metrics.md`
- v1.2.0 complete? → Evaluate `docs/requirements.md` (Category 1: 25 pts)
- v1.3.0 complete? → Evaluate `docs/architecture.md` (Category 2: 25 pts)
- v1.4.0 complete? → Evaluate `docs/tradeoffs.md` (Category 3: 30 pts)
- v1.5.0 complete? → Evaluate `docs/solution.md` (Category 4: 20 pts)
- v1.6.0 complete? → Full Phase 1 evaluation (100 pts + traceability)

### Files to Review

**Core Documents:**
- `docs/problem-statement.md` - Assignment requirements (source of truth)
- `docs/interview-rubric.md` - Evaluation criteria (0-100 points)
- `docs/requirements-policy.md` - Requirements standards

**Phase 1 Deliverables:**
- `docs/quality-metrics.md` - v1.1.0
- `docs/requirements.md` - v1.2.0 (generated from source/requirements.yaml)
- `docs/architecture.md` - v1.3.0
- `docs/tradeoffs.md` - v1.4.0
- `docs/solution.md` - v1.5.0

**Source Files:**

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Identify Scope (2 minutes)
1. Read TODO.md to determine current phase
2. Identify which deliverables are complete
3. Determine which rubric categories apply

### Step 2: Load Context (5 minutes)
1. Read `docs/interview-rubric.md` thoroughly
2. Read `docs/problem-statement.md` for requirements
3. Read all completed deliverable documents
4. Read `source/requirements.yaml` if v1.2.0+ complete

### Step 3: Systematic Evaluation (15-20 minutes)

For each applicable rubric category:

#### Category 1: Technical Requirements (25 pts) - v1.2.0+
**Evaluate `docs/requirements.md` and `source/requirements.yaml`:**

**Scoring:**
- Requirement Coverage: X/10
- Requirement Quality: X/10
- Standards & Compliance: X/5
- **Total: X/25**

#### Category 2: Alternative Solutions (25 pts) - v1.3.0+
**Evaluate `docs/architecture.md`:**

**Evaluate `docs/solution.md`:**
- [ ] Timeline: Detailed schedule addressing 2-month constraint?
- [ ] Manufacturing: DFM considerations, sourcing, testing strategy?
- [ ] Risk Mitigation: Timeline and supply chain risks addressed?

**Scoring:**
- Production Timeline: X/8

- Risk Mitigation: X/5
- **Total: X/20**

#### Category 5: Documentation Quality (10 pts) - Always applicable
**Evaluate all documents:**
- [ ] Clarity: Well-organized, professional?
- [ ] Visuals: Diagrams, tables, charts clear and useful?
- [ ] Technical Writing: Proper terminology, grammar, references?

**Scoring:**
- Clarity & Professionalism: X/10

### Step 4: Requirements Traceability (v1.6.0 only)
**Parse `source/requirements.yaml`:**
- [ ] All requirements have unique IDs following naming convention?
- [ ] All mandatory fields present (title, description, source, priority, category)?
- [ ] Traceability links valid (traces_to.design, traces_to.analysis)?
- [ ] Derived requirements show calculation?
- [ ] Coverage complete vs problem-statement.md?

**Generate traceability matrix:**
| Req ID | Source | Priority | Design Trace | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------------|--------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ✅/❌ |

**Identify gaps:**
- Orphaned requirements (no design trace)
- Missing requirements (problem statement not covered)
- Broken links

## Evaluation Principles

### Be Objective
- Base scores on rubric criteria from `docs/interview-rubric.md`
- Cite specific examples with file:line links
- Use performance level descriptions consistently
- Provide evidence for all deductions

### Be Constructive
- Highlight strengths before weaknesses
- Provide actionable recommendations, not complaints
- Explain WHY gaps matter, not just WHAT is missing

### Be Thorough
- Review ALL applicable documents
- Check ALL rubric criteria for current phase
- Don't skip sections
- Verify traceability links if v1.6.0

### Be Fair
- Remember this is concept evaluation, not production design
- Appropriate detail for phase (concept vs detailed design)
- Focus on thinking, justification, and decision-making
- Don't penalize for reasonable simplifications

### Be Honest
- If deliverables are incomplete, say so
- If analysis lacks data, call it out
- If gaps exist, explain impact
- Assign scores reflecting actual quality

---

## Context Reminders

**Interview Philosophy:**
- Lam wants to see HOW you think, not just WHAT you produce
- Justification and decision-making matter more than volume
- Production mindset (timeline, cost, manufacturing) is critical

**What Scores High:**
1. Clear reasoning and justification (WHY decisions made)
2. Quantitative analysis with data
3. Risk awareness and mitigation
4. Production feasibility thinking
5. Professional documentation

**What Doesn't Matter:**
1. Level of detail (concept-appropriate is fine)
2. Fancy visuals (clear > pretty)
3. Number of pages (concise > verbose)

---

## Ready to Evaluate

1. Read `docs/interview-rubric.md` thoroughly
2. Identify which phase/deliverables to evaluate
3. Review all applicable documents
4. Score each category using detailed checklists
5. Generate comprehensive report with hot links
6. Make gate decision (proceed? block? fix first?)
7. Save report to `artifacts/rubric-reports/`

**After completion:**
- Display executive summary to user
- Show current score and gate decision
- List critical actions needed (if any)
