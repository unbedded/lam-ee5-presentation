Complete git-flow release with comprehensive validation and branch synchronization: $ARGUMENTS

**Usage:** `/release-finish <version>`

**Required:**
- `<version>` - Version being released (must match release branch name)

**Examples:**
- `/release-finish 1.2.0` ‚Üí Merges release/1.2.0 to main and develop
- `/release-finish 2.0.0` ‚Üí Completes major release with full validation

## Educational Overview: Git-Flow Release Completion

<!--
WHAT HAPPENS DURING RELEASE FINISH?
This is the most critical operation in git-flow because it affects BOTH branches
that matter most: main (production) and develop (ongoing work).

THE DUAL-MERGE PROCESS:
1. Merge release branch ‚Üí main (deploys to production)
2. Merge release branch ‚Üí develop (keeps develop current)
3. Create git tag on main (marks the release)
4. Delete release branch (cleanup)

WHY BOTH MERGES ARE CRITICAL:
- main gets the release (production deployment)
- develop gets any bug fixes made during release preparation
- If develop doesn't get the bug fixes, they'll be lost in next release!

THIS IS WHERE THE "ACCIDENTAL MAIN MERGE" PROBLEM GETS SOLVED:
- Features go: develop ‚Üí release ‚Üí main (never feature ‚Üí main directly)
- Releases ensure both main and develop stay synchronized
- Validates that the right code goes to the right places
-->

## Critical Safety Validation (Pre-Finish Checks)

### 1. **Current Branch Verification**
<!--
WHY: You must be ON the release branch to finish it because:
- Git-flow needs to merge FROM the release branch
- Ensures you're completing the right release
- Prevents accidental merge from wrong branch

WHAT WE CHECK: git branch --show-current == "release/<version>"
-->
- Must be on `release/<version>` branch
- Version in command must match current branch name
- Prevents finishing wrong release or from wrong branch

### 2. **Working Tree Validation**
<!--
WHY: Clean working tree is CRITICAL for releases because:
- Uncommitted changes could accidentally be included in production
- Dirty tree can cause merge conflicts during dual-merge process
- Release should contain only intentional, committed changes

WHAT WE CHECK: git status --porcelain (must be empty)
-->
- Absolutely no uncommitted changes allowed
- No untracked files that might be important
- Release must contain only committed, reviewed changes

### 3. **Quality Gate Enforcement**
<!--
WHY THESE QUALITY CHECKS MATTER:
- Broken code should never reach main (production)
- Tests ensure functionality works as expected
- Linting catches style issues and potential bugs
- Type checking prevents runtime type errors

FOR RELEASES, WE'RE EXTRA STRICT:
- ALL tests must pass (no exceptions)
- ALL linting issues must be resolved
- ALL type checking must be clean
- This is the last checkpoint before production
-->
- **Code Quality**: Run `/check-code` - all linting and type checking must pass
- **Test Suite**: Run `/run-tests` - 100% test success required
- **Version Consistency**: VERSION file must match release branch name
- **CHANGELOG Validation**: Must have entry for this version

### 4. **Target Branch Readiness**
<!--
WHY TARGET BRANCHES MUST BE READY:
- main: Must exist and be the production branch
- develop: Must exist and be current (for receiving bug fixes)
- Both must be synchronized with remote (team collaboration)

SYNCHRONIZATION PREVENTS:
- Losing other people's work during merge
- Merge conflicts from outdated branches
- Deployment of incomplete code
-->
- `main` branch exists and is up-to-date with remote
- `develop` branch exists and is up-to-date with remote
- No merge conflicts detected between release and target branches

## Enhanced Merge Process with Validation

### Phase 1: Pre-Merge Validation
```bash
# Critical safety checks before any merges happen
git status --porcelain                           # Working tree clean
git fetch origin                                 # Update remote refs
git show-branch main develop release/<version>   # Verify branches exist
git merge-tree main release/<version>            # Check for conflicts with main
git merge-tree develop release/<version>         # Check for conflicts with develop
```

### Phase 2: Quality Gate Execution
<!--
QUALITY GATES ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE FOR RELEASES:
These commands must succeed before any merge happens.
If any fail, the release process stops and shows specific errors to fix.
-->
- Execute `make quality` (language-appropriate linting, formatting, type checking)
- Execute `make test-full` (comprehensive test suite with coverage)
- Validate VERSION file content matches `<version>` argument
- Confirm CHANGELOG.md has entry for this version

### Phase 3: Git-Flow Release Finish
<!--
WHAT git flow release finish DOES:
1. Switches to main branch
2. Merges release/<version> into main
3. Creates annotated git tag (v<version>) on main
4. Switches to develop branch
5. Merges release/<version> into develop
6. Deletes local release/<version> branch

WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS:
- main gets the release first (production deployment)
- Tag is created on main (proper release marking)
- develop gets the same changes (synchronization)
- Release branch cleanup (prevents confusion)

PROJECT-SPECIFIC OVERRIDE FOR ASSIGNMENT EVALUATION:
- DELETE local branch (cleanup)
- KEEP remote branch (evaluation evidence)
- Assignment requires "Multiple meaningful commits showing development progression"
- Remote branches demonstrate version control maturity and workflow
-->
```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/<version> -m "Merge release/<version> into main"

# Create tag
git tag -a v<version> -m "Release v<version>"

# Merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/<version> -m "Merge release/<version> into develop"

# Delete LOCAL branch only (keep remote for evaluation)
git branch -d release/<version>
```

### Phase 4: Post-Merge Validation & Synchronization
<!--
CRITICAL POST-MERGE CHECKS:
Even after git-flow finishes, we must verify everything worked correctly:
-->

#### **Branch Hash Synchronization Verification**
<!--
WHY CHECK BRANCH HASHES:
After a release, main and develop should point to the same commit
(or develop should be ahead by merge commit only).

WHAT WE'RE DETECTING:
- Failed merge-back to develop (develop missing release changes)
- Merge conflicts that weren't properly resolved
- Git-flow command that didn't complete fully

HOW WE CHECK:
- git rev-parse main (get main commit hash)
- git rev-parse develop (get develop commit hash)
- git merge-base main develop (should be main's hash for clean release)
-->
```bash
# Verify branches are properly synchronized
main_hash=$(git rev-parse main)
develop_hash=$(git rev-parse develop)
merge_base=$(git merge-base main develop)

# For clean release: merge_base should equal main_hash
# develop_hash should equal main_hash OR be one commit ahead (merge commit)
```

#### **Tag Verification**
<!--
WHY TAG VALIDATION MATTERS:
- Tags are used by deployment systems to identify releases
- Wrong tag could deploy wrong code version
- Missing tag means deployment automation fails

WHAT WE CHECK:
- Tag exists locally: git tag -l "v<version>"
- Tag points to correct commit: git rev-parse "v<version>" == main_hash
- Tag is annotated (not lightweight): git cat-file -t "v<version>" == "tag"
-->
```bash
# Verify release tag was created correctly
git tag -l "v<version>"                    # Tag exists
tag_hash=$(git rev-parse "v<version>")     # Tag commit hash
main_hash=$(git rev-parse main)            # Main commit hash
# tag_hash should equal main_hash
```

#### **Remote Synchronization**
<!--
WHY PUSH TO REMOTE:
- Team needs to see the release branches and tags
- CI/CD systems deploy from remote repositories
- Backup of release work

WHAT WE PUSH:
- main branch (production code)
- develop branch (synchronized development)
- Tags (release markers)

PUSH ORDER MATTERS:
- Push main first (production deployment trigger)
- Then develop (team synchronization)
- Finally tags (release automation trigger)
-->
```bash
git push origin main         # Production deployment
git push origin develop      # Development synchronization
git push origin --tags       # Release tags for automation
```

## Advanced Error Detection & Recovery

### **Quality Gate Failures**
```
‚ùå Quality gates failed - Release blocked

üß™ Test Failures (3):
   ‚Ä¢ test_authentication.py::test_login_flow
   ‚Ä¢ test_api.py::test_user_creation
   ‚Ä¢ test_integration.py::test_checkout_process

üîß Required fixes:
   1. Fix failing tests on release branch
   2. Commit fixes: git add . && git commit -m "Fix release tests"
   3. Re-run: /release-finish 1.2.0

‚ö†Ô∏è  DO NOT proceed without fixing tests - production deployment will fail!
```

### **Branch Synchronization Issues**
```
‚ùå Branch synchronization problem detected

üìä Branch State Analysis:
   ‚Ä¢ main:    commit abc123f "Previous release v1.1.0"
   ‚Ä¢ develop: commit def456g "Feature XYZ merged"
   ‚Ä¢ release: commit 789hijf "Release v1.2.0 ready"

‚ö†Ô∏è  Problem: develop is ahead of main, but should be synchronized after release

üîß Recovery procedure:
   1. This suggests an incomplete previous release
   2. Run /release-doctor for detailed diagnosis
   3. May need manual branch synchronization
```

### **Tag Creation Failures**
```
‚ùå Git tag creation failed

üè∑Ô∏è  Tag Issues:
   ‚Ä¢ Tag v1.2.0 already exists locally
   ‚Ä¢ Tag points to different commit: commit abc123f
   ‚Ä¢ Expected commit: def456g

üîß Recovery options:
   1. Delete existing tag: git tag -d v1.2.0
   2. Re-run release finish: /release-finish 1.2.0
   3. Or fix tag manually: git tag -f -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"
```

### **Remote Push Failures**
```
‚ùå Failed to push to remote

üåê Push Status:
   ‚úÖ main ‚Üí origin/main (success)
   ‚ùå develop ‚Üí origin/develop (rejected)
   ‚è∏Ô∏è  tags (skipped due to develop failure)

üîß Common causes:
   ‚Ä¢ develop is behind remote (need git pull origin develop first)
   ‚Ä¢ Network connectivity issues
   ‚Ä¢ Authentication problems
   ‚Ä¢ Remote repository permissions

Fix: git pull origin develop && git push origin develop && git push origin --tags
```

## Success Confirmation & Next Steps

### **Successful Release Output**
```
‚úÖ Release v1.2.0 completed successfully!

üìä Release Summary:
   ‚Ä¢ Source: release/1.2.0 ‚Üí ‚úÖ deleted
   ‚Ä¢ Target: main (commit def456g) ‚Üí ‚úÖ updated
   ‚Ä¢ Merge-back: develop (commit def456g) ‚Üí ‚úÖ synchronized
   ‚Ä¢ Tag: v1.2.0 ‚Üí ‚úÖ created and pushed
   ‚Ä¢ Remote sync: ‚úÖ all branches and tags pushed

üöÄ Production Deployment:
   ‚Ä¢ Code is ready for production deployment
   ‚Ä¢ Version tag v1.2.0 available for CI/CD systems
   ‚Ä¢ All branches synchronized with remote

üîÑ Next Development Cycle:
   ‚Ä¢ New features can be started from develop
   ‚Ä¢ develop branch contains v1.2.0 + any ongoing work
   ‚Ä¢ Ready for next release cycle
```

## Git-Flow Best Practices Reinforcement

<!--
EDUCATIONAL SUMMARY: What this release process achieves

1. PRODUCTION SAFETY:
   - Only tested, quality-checked code reaches main
   - Clear version marking with git tags
   - Rollback capability to any previous release

2. DEVELOPMENT CONTINUITY:
   - develop stays current with all changes
   - Bug fixes from release are not lost
   - Team can continue new features immediately

3. TEAM COLLABORATION:
   - All changes pushed to remote for team access
   - Clear release markers for deployment automation
   - Consistent process that everyone can follow

4. MISTAKE PREVENTION:
   - Multiple validation checkpoints prevent errors
   - Automatic verification of critical operations
   - Clear error messages with specific fix procedures

This addresses your original problem: "trouble merging from feature branch to develop -
by accident it went onto main." The release process ensures:
- Features NEVER go directly to main
- Only release branches (tested, validated) merge to main
- develop and main stay synchronized through the release process
-->

### **The Release Safety Model:**
1. **Features** ‚Üí `develop` (integration testing)
2. **Releases** ‚Üí `main` + `develop` (production + synchronization)
3. **Hotfixes** ‚Üí `main` + `develop` (emergency fixes + synchronization)

### **Why This Prevents Accidental Main Merges:**
- Features can only merge to develop (enforced by git-flow)
- Main only receives code through release/hotfix process
- Every main update is validated, tested, and tagged
- develop and main synchronization is automatic and verified

## Integration Points

- Called after `/release-start` completion and release preparation
- Uses `/health-check-git` for comprehensive validation
- Integrates with `make quality` and `make test-full` for language-agnostic quality gates
- Connects to upcoming `/release-doctor` for error recovery
