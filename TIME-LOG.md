## Notes

- Log time in 0.5 hour increments minimum
- Be honest about time spent (includes research, breaks, context switching)
- Update this file using `/status` slash command
- If a phase goes over estimate, that's OK - log it and adjust other phases
- Focus on high-value work (rubric weights: Tradeoffs 30%, Requirements 25%, Solutions 25%, Production 20%)
